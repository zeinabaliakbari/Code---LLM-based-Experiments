1 Introduction  

The success of a company is dependent on multiple internal and external 
factors that are classically divided in three categories, which are related to 
each other: time, costs and quality. The classical management approach to 
improve manufacturing performance is also built on the time-cost-quality 
trade-off theory. Those important factors are constantly controlled and 
evaluated. For time, the production lead-time is measured. For costs, the 
resource consumption and process dependent cost are considered. For 
quality, the first pass yield and the delivery quality can be measured. 
However with the rising importance of energy and resource consumption, 
the trade-off model was expanded by the factor energy and resource 
consumption in the frame of green controlling [1]. 

The desire to produce energy and resource efficiently began to grow 
caused not only by the rising energy expenses and by the increasing 
environmental awareness, but also through the legislations in energy 
policy by the German government. The electricity supply from renewable 
energy sources is regulated nationwide by the German law for 
development of renewable energies. The main driver of this development 
is the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000, which aims to 
achieve an 80% share of renewable energies in the electricity mix by 2050. 
Renewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaic are 
dependent on weather and daytime. While coal-fired and nuclear power 
plants produce electricity constantly, the supply from renewable energy 
sources is rather unstable. With its rising share, the electricity supply 
changes. To adapt to these changes, an adjustment in consumer behavior 
is necessary to ensure the stability of the electricity supply [2] [3] [4]. 
Beyond the legislations perspective, the annual greenhouse gas emissions 
shall be reduced by 80% up to 95% until 2050 in comparison to 1990 and 
Germany will refrain from using nuclear power [5]. 

For these reasons, the pressure on manufacturing companies for a 
resource efficient setup began to grow in recent years. Unlike the other 
factors in management trade-off performance, energy factor is difficult to 
measure. To determine the energy efficiency of processes, performance 
key indicators were developed for manufacturing processes with discrete 
production [6], as well as for energy-intensive industries with continuous 
production [7]. The exergy method is the most popular which is mostly 
used to investigate the complex thermodynamic processes such as textile 
and chemical industries, and less in manufacturing industries such as in

1   Introduction 
 

electronics production. Since energy methods only involve the 1st law of 
thermodynamics and thus ignore the difference between work and heat, 
these methods lack factors which are required to adequately show a 
system effectiveness utilizing given energy resources. Exergy methods also 
take the second law of thermodynamics into account, and therefore, 
better suited for thermodynamic processes. As for packaging process and 
electronics assembly, the soldering process is the most energy intensive 
process, and therefore exergy analysis suits to investigate the heat transfer 
complexities [8] [9]. 

Beyond the importance of energy factor, quality factor for electronic 
products is inevitably improving. Explicitly for modern electronics 
products increasingly demand the features of lighter weight, smaller size, 
and higher quality, high pin-count, and various other product 
configurations. This is particularly evident in mobile and 
telecommunication devices. Surface mount technology (SMT) is the 
primary method used to attach electronic components permanently onto 
the substrate. A crucial improvement in quality of connecting 
technologies is to avoid heat dissipation through the joints and increase 
the reliability of connectivity. Less creation of voids (pores) in solder joint 
obtains this advancement. While a significant level of voiding can be 
tolerated in solder joints where electrical conductivity is the main 
requirement, voiding at any level severely compromises thermal 
conductivity. For instance, in Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting 
modules effective conduction of heat through the 1st level die attach to the 
substrate and then through the 2nd level attach to the heat sink is critical 
to performance so that voiding in the solder joints at both levels must be 
minimized.  Voids in solder joints are the result of bubbles of gas that do 
not escape before the solder has solidified [10]. To release the entrapped 
bubbles several German technology producers have offered new solutions 
in the market. IBL Tech. combines the advantages of the vapor phase 
soldering technology with vacuum process. SEHO Systems GmbH offered 
a soldering oven combined with an overpressure module. These 
technologies are proving the reduction of voids and hence delivering 
namely a void-free solder joint.  

Any of the four above explained criteria and factors for manufacturing 
performance of soldering process is solely optimizable. However, by 
deploying a trade-off decision making approach, a multi-objective 
optimization solution is obtainable. The decision making is considered as 
a problem with a finite set of projects, a finite set of criteria, and set of 
evaluations of projects with respect to criteria. In this study, the decision 

2 



1.1   Objectives of the Thesis 
 
 

projects are evaluated with respect to four criteria and a trade-off between 
energy, quality, cost and time. The feasibility of a multi-objective 
optimization and a multiple criterion decision making problem lies on the 
compromised intermediate preferences with respect to the set of 
objectives defined by the decision makers.   

1.1 Objectives of the Thesis 

To build a cumulative multi-objective solution for overpressure soldering 
process, each energy, quality, cost, and time criterion will be first 
optimized. First, the quality of soldering process and a void-free solder 
joint is targeted. The laboratory facilities from FAPS institute are used to 
conduct the study and acquire the data. The overpressure soldering 
concept is evidencing the improvement of void fraction reduction, 
however the process controlling mechanism and the impact on the final 
result should be furtherly investigated. A set of design of experiments is 
obtaining the platform to analyze the most influential variables on void 
reduction. The statistical analysis is obtaining the degree of influence and 
interaction of variables on the response and the void fraction creation. 
The variables interaction measure is targeting the overpressure module to 
realize the best mechanism for a void-free soldering process.  

The most influential variables on quality are delivering soldering profiles 
that are used to investigate the optimization potentials for time, cost and 
energy factors. Therefore, the soldering process will be simulated to 
imitate the production lead-time per PCB to consider any non-productive 
time including the process breakages and non-predictable waiting times. 
A transparency model for resource flow is developed and the associated 
resources flow in the simulation model reveals the saving potentials, and 
it is obtaining the variable cost for the utilized resources per PCB. By 
development of “is-analysis” for the current resource flow, a method is 
utilized to investigate the value-added action in soldering process, and 
therefore defining a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), which is revealing 
the minimum required resource per PCB. The minimum required 
resource per each solder profile is statistical analyzed to realize the most 
influencing variable and therefore the potential saving measures to reduce 
the resource consumption and the incurred cost. 

The variable set of input parameters for each response in the trade-off 
model for quality, energy, cost and time factor shall be optimized. 
Therefore, for the sake of comprehensibility and comparability, an 
intelligence-based algorithm and a mathematics-based model per each 

3 



1   Introduction 
 

criterion is developed. Further, the intelligence-based models are utilized 
as tools to predict the response values in the trade-off model. With 
respect to optimal solutions for each criterion, a holistic solution is not 
obtainable. Therefore, deployment of a ranking approach along a decision 
making model is delivering a compromised multi-objective optimization 
solution for overpressure soldering process.  

1.2 Organization of the Dissertation 

This study is divided into nine chapters. In the second chapter, the state-
of-the-art for advanced soldering technologies for a void-free soldering 
process is elaborated. Further, the classical project management trade-off 
model is explained and extended by the energy criterion. The constraints 
per each criterion are defined, and the overviews of the mathematical 
methods are presented which are utilized for analysis, modeling and 
process optimization.  

Chapter three introduces primarily an Ishikawa diagram and Five-M 
diagram for soldering process. A method is presented which is formulating 
the connection of objectives, the trade-off model and the methods that 
are used to target a multi-objective process optimization. Furthermore, 
materials and machines that are utilized to conduct, test and analyze the 
experimental part of this study are presented. Manpower and mother 
nature are excluded in this study. 

Chapter four is aiming to study the thermal profiling process in terms of 
quality criterion optimization. The soldering oven technology integrated 
with overpressure module is investigated in detail to identify the most 
influencing variables on quality indicators. These variables are examined 
as set of experiments in screening process before the full factorial design 
of experiment due to the sake of cost and time saving. In parallel with the 
conduction of final design of experiment, the production lead-time and 
the electrical energy consumption of the oven technology are measured. 
The data from this set of experiments are utilized for the multi-objective 
optimization approach. 

The chapter five is presenting a control procedure for the resource flow in 
soldering process. In order to cope with the dynamics of the process 
chains, simulation method is a promising approach. Therefore, first a 
transparency model is developed which is illustrating the flow of electrical 
energy of the oven technology and auxiliary equipment in periphery 
levels. Then a simulation tool is utilized by means of imitation purposes

1.2   Organization of the Dissertation 
 
 

in order to consider the predictable and non-predictable process breaks in 
the total power consumption of the case study soldering process. By 
realizing the resource flow balance of the process an exergy method is 
conducted and the investigation is followed by statistical analysis. The 
analysis is presented by a meta-model to realize the most influencing 
setup parameters of the oven technology on periphery levels and how to 
deduce the increase of the exergy efficiency of the process. In the 
following part of this chapter, the cost analysis is conducted. The cost for 
the process-related resource flow is elaborated, and the statistical analysis 
of the total cost is revealing the effect of oven technology setup changes 
and the respective power consumption interaction on the total cost of the 
PCB product. 

In the chapter six, the soldering process is mathematically modeled for 
prediction application and to study the behavior of the system. The 
experimental designs are obtaining the input data for the Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANN) and Response Surface Method (RSM) models. The ANN 
model is starting with definition of input and response parameters, 
creation of the topology and the model architecture. The data training 
process and the measure of the error given by the verified models are 
demonstrating the reliability of the ANN model for the given data series. 
The RSM model is created based on the given solutions by the software, 
and hence after definition of the problem, input and response data, the 
reliability of the model is verified by the obtained set of statistical data. 
Once the reliabilities of models are proven, the experimental input data 
are used for the prediction application and to check the error deviation. 
The model with less error ratio is selected for further prediction of input 
data which are not set in the initial DOE. 

In chapter seven, a compromised intermediate equation model is 
presented which is obtaining a decision-based optimization solution. 
Finding the optimal solution for all these responses however is possible 
but not satisfactory, due to the fact that a holistic solution is not 
obtainable. Therefore, a trade-off performance model is developed that 
the decision maker is able to achieve the target setup including the 
boundary of set of optimized performances. A vector-based compromised 
solution is presented to control the weight of all performances for a multi-
objective solution. The optimized solutions are furtherly experimentally 
verified to prove the accuracy of the developed prediction models.

2 State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns 
and Optimization Solutions 

This chapter gives an overview on the state of science, technology and 
methodology, which is necessary to understand this study. Firstly, the 
electronics production process chain is briefly explained. The focus is on 
the convection-based reflow soldering process and enhanced technologies 
to reduce voids in solder joints. Furtherly, the expansion of the classical 
project management trade-off model by the energy criterion for a 
comprehensive evaluation and multi-optimization of soldering process is 
elaborated. Lastly, the mathematical methods utilized for the analysis, 
modeling and process optimization are discussed.  

2.1 Soldering Process Technology and the Mechanisms 

2.1.1 Surface Mount Technology (SMT) Assembly 

The production of electronic devices usually follows a certain pattern, in 
which Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly is an essential part of the 
manufacturing process. The Surface Mount Technology (SMT) is an 
important method used to directly attach the Surface Mounted 
Components (SMCs) onto the pads of the PCB, as shown in Figure 1. 

 
Figure 1: The Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly process [11] 

7 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

The SMT assembly consists of three consecutive process steps: pasting the 
solder material through stencil printing, component placement process 
using an automated robotic system, and the soldering process. In Surface 
Mount Assembly (SMA), the solder paste is first deposited onto the solder 
pads of the PCB through stencil printing application (Figure 1, a)). In the 
next step, as shown in Figure 1, b), the SMCs are placed on the substrate 
using a placing machine. The mounted substrates are then conveyed into 
a soldering oven to form strong solder joints (Figure 1, c)) [12]. Lastly, the 
mounted boards are sent to visual inspection process using an Automated 
Optical Inspection (AOI) system to prove the solder joint quality. If 
soldering failures or the solder joints defects occur, the defective boards 
are sent to rework station for correction [13]. 

2.1.2 Convection-based Soldering Process  

The solder reflow process is one of the key determinants of SMT 
assembly. A thermal profile is indicated by a time-temperature graph that 
is used to control the heating rate on the PCB product in the reflow oven. 
The heat in the convection-based reflow soldering oven is generated by 
reflow convection modules, and a turbulently flowing gas generated via 
air jets transmits a uniform temperature on the PCB [14]. 

In the convection-based soldering oven, as shown in Figure 2 for a typical 
profile for lead-free solder alloys, the substrate and the components are 
warmed up in the preheating zone, where the temperature quickly rises 
from ambient temperature to about 160 °C. An increase in temperature to 
190 °C activates the flux and it is wetting1 the metallic surfaces of the 
solder pads and component leads in the soaking zone in the soaking 
temperature (𝑇𝑆). In the reflow zone, the solder particles are melted and 
liquefied in liquidus temperature (𝑇𝐿) for the liquidus time (𝑡𝐿). The PCB 
is furtherly heated up to the peak temperature (𝑇𝑃), which is held for the 
peak time (𝑡𝑃). During this process, an intermetallic layer between the 
solder material, the copper and the metal part of electronics component is 
formed.

 Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from 
intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together.

Figure 2: Conventional reflow soldering temperature profile 

An Intermetallic Crystal (IMC) is a combination of all base metals that 
provides the mechanical and electrical integrity of the solder joint. When 
soldering to a copper substrate with the standard Sn-based solder 
material, two types of IMCs are formed (Figure 3). The copper-rich Cu3Sn 
intermetallic, which melts at 670 °C, is found near the substrate, while the 
tin-rich Cu6Sn5, which melts at 415 °C, is found throughout the joint. As 
the melting temperatures of these are significantly higher than soldering 
temperatures, they will not be melted during the reflow process and thus 
will remain in the joint as occlusions. During soldering, the intermetallic 
crystals are formed. This IMC will continue to form at a slower rate in the 
solid phase. The growth as a solid is driven by temperature; as the solder 
profile approaches its melting point, the rate of IMC growth increases [15].

Finally, strong solder joints between component leads and solder pads are 
formed in the cooling zone of the reflow technology. The heating 
parameter settings such as working mode of the reflow oven, conveyor 
speed, solder paste ingredients, and number of components assembled 
can affect the acceptance of a thermal profile. The use of an inadequate 
thermal profile can generate numerous soldering failures such as, solder 
balling, tombstoning, solder voiding, solder bridging, and incomplete 
solder joints  [17] [18] [19]. 

2.1.3 Solder Joint Defects in Electronics Production 

Solder joint quality is extremely important in order to assure the 
reliability of electronic products in the electronics assembly [20] [21]. The 
reflow soldering process is recognized as one of the major sources of 
soldering defects [14]. The thermal profiling and the machine setup is 
highly dependent on the type of solder alloy material, and hence by the 
change of product, the oven machine should be reconfigured. The 
homogeneity and the efficiency of the heat transport have strong 
influence on the solder joints, because an inhomogeneous temperature 
profile can cause reflow soldering failures [18] [22]. The common solder 
joint defects are shown in Figure 4.  

 
Figure 4: Common solder joint defects [23]

2.1   Soldering Process Technology and the Mechanisms 
 
 

Several studies were conducted to examine the effect of thermal 
management and heating transfer capability examination of reflow ovens. 
These are including the application of simple temperature distribution 
measurements [24] [25], simulation process [26] [26], thermal models of 
the reflow process[22] [27], heat gas circulation and heat transfer 
coefficient [22] [28] investigations. In practice, the defect on the PCB as 
the result of an inhomogeneous heat transfer requires additional repairs 
and reworking that can cause a loss of productivity of roughly 30–50% of 
the total manufacturing costs [29], and therefore they should be avoided. 

Fractured solder 

Fractured solder joints are an uncommon solder joint defect, which is 
normally caused by thermal expansion of the joint. To keep the 
mechanical stress as low as possible, the cooling rate should be low. 
However, the higher the solder joint cooling rate, the higher its strength 
will be [23] [30].      

Tombstones 

Tombstones describe an effect when components rise on one side during 
the soldering process. It occurs especially on small and light two-pole 
components. The effect arises when one side of the solder liquefies earlier 
than the other. Reasons for this behavior can be placement process or the 
temperature profiling. A slow heating in the preheating helps to avoid 
tombstoning. Depending on the angle, tombstones can be detected 
visually [23] [31] [32]. 

Delamination 

Delamination is a partial separation of the base material layers. In the 
delamination area, the material strength is reduced and components 
might come off. Delamination is caused by excessive thermal stress on the 
PCB, humidity or impurities in the material. According to the IPC-A-
610D, delamination is still acceptable if its ratio is under 30%. To avoid 
delamination, the soldering process should be shortened or conducted at 
lower temperatures [23] [32]. 

Non-wetting 

Non-wetting is the incapability of molten solder to engage a metallurgical 
connection with the basis metal. To avoid non-wetting, the flux should be 
fully activated. Therefore, the length of temperature profile must be long 
enough to completely activate the flux, but not too long to avoid 
consuming its activator too early. Additionally, it must be warm enough 

11 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

to melt the solder, but not too hot as this can cause unwanted oxidation 
processes [23] [31].  

Cold connection 

A cold connection is a poorly wetted solder joint which appears grey. This 
is caused by inadequate cleaning and lubricated surface before the 
soldering process and/or insufficient heat supply during the soldering 
process [23].  

Solder balls 

Solder balls are balls out of solder, which remain after the soldering 
process. They can be caused by numerous reasons like spattering, 
excessive oxidation or poor process conditions causing gassing from the 
flux. Solder balls are acceptable, if they are embedded, encapsulated, fixed 
or do not violate the minimum electrical isolation distance. Despite the 
majority of solder balls is not caused during the soldering process, a slow 
heating in preheating zone helps to avoid them [23] [31]. 

Solder bridges 

Solder bridges occur when the solder is not able to separate from two or 
more electrical connections. After the solidification, the unwanted 
connection might cause short circuits. To avoid solder bridges, a low 
heating rate is recommended [18] [23].  

Voids 

Voids are small inclusions of gas or fluid in the solder joint. If the voids 
are big enough or placed in an unfavorable order, they decrease the 
mechanical strength of the solder joint. Additionally, voids change the 
thermal and electrical properties of the solder joint. Voids should be 
investigated by X-ray technology and it is very difficult to avoid them 
completely. According to IPC-A-610D, a void ratio of 30% or less is 
acceptable and a higher fraction is considered as defect. IPC-A-610D is 
also classifying the electronics products into class 1, 2 and 3, which class 1 
allows a void ratio up to 30% for general electronics products application, 
and class 3 for high-performance electronic devices should be less than 
5% and it allows no voids [18] [23] [33] [34]. The void fraction should be 
directly agreed with the customer.

2.1.4 Mechanism of Void Creation in Solder Joint 

The influencing factors on void development can be divided in the four 
categories: soldering process, PCB, solder paste and electronic 
components (Figure 5). Diehm et al. [33] investigated the influence of 
these factors on void creation. Regarding the soldering process it is 
concluded that the applied soldering technique, the temperature profile, 
the soldering atmosphere, the soldering temperature, the holding time 
above the liquidus temperature and the environmental conditions are 
influencing the void development. Also, the solder paste alloy 
composition, powder quality, powder size, metal content and flux 
composition. The substrate material has an influence on void 
development, as well as the surface metallization, the surface condition, 
and the solder resist and MicroVia2  [35] [36]. 

 
Figure 5: Influential factors on voids development [37] 

The homogeneity of the solder joint is crucial for better thermal and 
electrical performance. Apart from the utilized material, the soldering 
thermal treatment is changing the form of void creation process. In 
soldering process, voids formed due to poor wetting of the parent 
materials or improper outgassing and it impairs the homogeneity and 
degrade the product service lifetime [16]. Especially in large-area solder 
connections and power electronics, voids if not outgassed properly result 
in tilting or even damage of the component. Also, the connection between 
the size and position of voids in the solder joint may affect the reliability 
of the solder joint during the use phase of the product life cycle.

 Microvias are holes drilled by a laser to generate the electrical connection between the 

layers in a multilayer circuit board. Via in pad microvias play a decisive role in the 
miniaturization of circuit boards.  

13 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

Therefore, commonly the destructive tests such as shear force test are 
conducted to study the connection of the size and position of voids with 
the reliability of the solder joint. 

Voids in the solder joints are nearly inevitable for common reflow 
soldering process conditions. As shown in Figure 6, after the placement 
process of electronic component, the solder material in the reflow oven is 
starting to melt. First, the solvent material is starting to evaporate, the 
smaller voids are forming larger voids. If the solder paste is melting 
sooner than the alloy of the solder balls, the evaporating flux has a chance 
to escape from solder gap before the balls are melting. Hence, less gases 
and residues will be enclosed in the solder joints in this case [33]. 
Therefore, the ingredients of the solder pastes, the evaporation 
temperature of solvent, which are evaporating during the soldering 
process, affect the final amount of enclosure gases.  

 
Figure 6: Soldering process from left to right: a. after placement, b. solving agent starts to 
evaporate, c. solving agent is vaporized, d. gas production after melting of solder [38] 

The gas created in molten solder is in a thermodynamically unstable 
situation. The bubble creates an additional surface in the solder, which 
means that the free energy of the system is higher than it would be if the 
gas had escaped. The extra free energy provides a driving force for larger 
bubbles which have a smaller surface area to-volume ratio, to grow at the 
expense of smaller bubbles. However, if this occurs only by gaseous 
diffusion through the liquid the process is very slow. Faster growth can 
occur by coalescence if the bubbles are being moved by other forces so 
that they come into contact with other bubbles. In such a contact the 
micro voids will be absorbed into the macro voids with a net reduction in 
the area of the gas/solder interface. In reflowing solder paste there is 
sufficient movement for that to occur so that voiding in solder joints 
typically occurs as a relatively small number of larger voids [10]. Because 
of the ambition of gas bubbles and liquid enclosures to minimize their 
surface, the voids will contract in the solder gap depending on the size. 
Because the distribution of voids in the solder gap is rarely uniform and 

14 



2.1   Soldering Process Technology and the Mechanisms 
 
 

micro voids can cumulate to larger voids, a tilting of component is the 
result as a rule. A high tilt intensifies inevitably the inhomogeneity, the 
non-uniform distribution of currents and temperature and the 
thermomechanical stress [33]. 

By introduction of lead-free solders with the well-known difficulties of 
poor wetting and smaller process windows the outgassing process of voids 
has become more acute. Through wetting balance analysis, a faster 
wetting and shorter profiles at 10% above the melting point of solder alloy 
contribute to reduce voids and increase the chance of bubbles leaving the 
solder joint [33]. The Fraunhofer Institutes IZM and ISiT have investigated 
the forming and development of voids with more than 200 test boards in 
a joint research project [39]. Solder joints were observed by X-ray analysis 
also during the soldering process in this project. It was clearly visible that 
voids that have already been formed will never escape if keeping the 
soldering temperature. In addition, the apparent effect can be observed: 
the voids increase during holding of soldering temperature. However, this 
is usually caused by the accumulation of several smaller voids, which are 
under the resolution limit themselves, into larger voids with clearly visible 
sizes. But there are also some cases, when voids can be formed by 
dewetting3 effects of component terminations or outgassing from PCB 
material during dwelling of soldering temperature [33].    

2.1.5 Void Mitigation Strategies in Soldering Process 

The Young-Laplace equation is explaining the capillary pressure 
difference sustained across the interface between static fluids. According 
to this equation for a particular bubble, assuming the mass of the gas 
contained is fixed, the size of the bubble at a given temperature depends 
on the surface tension of the solder and the atmospheric pressure. The 
tension of the surface behaves against the pressure limiting the size of the 
bubble can reach for a given constant pressure. It is clear therefore if the 
surface tension is smaller, the overpressure that can be sustained is 
reduced, and for a given mass of contained volatiles, the bubble can 
increase in size [10].  

According to this principle, the key elements of void mitigation either 
could be the alloy combination with the flux and solvent of solder, or the 
                                                     
3
 The terms de- or nonwetting are applied when a surface does not accept the liquid 

solder. In this case, no diffusional reaction between the liquid solder and the interface of 
the substrate takes place, and a diffusion layer in the form of an intermetallic zone is not 
formed. 

15 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

change of atmospheric soldering process controls. If voids are produced 
due to improper outgassing process of solvent, then the size of a void that 
can reach and the ease with which it can break through the surface of the 
solder and escape is affected by the surface tension of the solder. A lower 
surface tension of the molten solder is obtaining a larger void, and more 
likely a higher chance to intersect the solder surface and release of 
entrapped bubble.  

By considering the void mitigation through elimination of solvents from 
the formulation of the solder paste ingredients, either flux should be not 
begin to volatile or decompose to create gas until late in the reflow 
profile. Therefore, the solvent should be completely evaporated in the 
preheating or just before the reflow phase. However, other ingredients in 
the flux medium, the resins, activators, thixotropic agents, and stabilizers 
should remain stable with minimal release of volatiles, particularly during 
the latter part of the profile when the solder is molten (time above 
liquidus) [10]. Due to the uncontrollable evaporation of flux, hence it is 
impossible to assure the complete release of gas before the reflow process. 
By controlling the atmospheric pressure of the solder material and 
reducing the surface tension helps the gases trapped in the solder 
material reaching to the surface. Hence, as shown in Figure 7, a pressure 
difference between the solvent gas and the environment is demanding 
when the solder material is in liquid state.   

 
Figure 7: Effects of pressure change during reflow soldering process [40] 

2.1.6 Mechanisms of Void-free Soldering Process 
Technologies 

An approach presented for reflow soldering through pressure difference is 
soldering process combined with a vacuum module. Thereby, the vacuum 
process is added as module after the peak zone. Vacuum is defined as the 
state of a gas, when its pressure and thus the particle-number density is 
lower within than it is outside of its container [41]. Diehm et al. [33] has 

16 



2.1   Soldering Process Technology and the Mechanisms 
 
 

suggested that a minimum of 100 mbar pressure difference between inside 
of void and its environment is necessary to remove gases. This means, 
that after soldering at normal pressure, the ambient pressure must 
decrease to 900 mbar or less in order to remove voids. As shown in Figure 
7, the gas and flux inclusions in the solder joints expand during the 
vacuum phase and move out of the joint. The vacuum is generated when 
the peak temperature is reached. At this point, the solder is liquid. When 
comparing the temperature profiles of a conventional reflow soldering 
process and a vacuum reflow soldering process, it is conspicuous that for 
the vacuum process, the peak temperature needs to be held longer Figure 
8, b). This is because the void reduction process must not be run too 
quickly [42]. 

There are several disadvantages of a vacuum in soldering process. During 
the vacuum process, the PCB materials and some components are tending 
to excessive outgassing. Therefore, the targeted vacuum will be achieved 
very slowly. In addition, some electrolyte capacitors cannot tolerate the 
vacuum process because of the hermetically enclosed liquids. Another 
drawback is that heat cannot be transferred in the vacuum with the usual 
convection heating but only by means of infrared radiation or heat 
conduction. Both heating methods are not sufficient for the use on PCBs. 

The assemblies have to be heated sufficiently during the soldering 
process, so that the solder is still liquid in the following vacuum process. 
To ensure the minimum thermal radiation exposure on the PCB product 
during the vacuum process, it is essential to achieve a fast transition from 
the soldering zone into the vacuum area which requires a powerful lock 
and pump system as well as optimum vacuum pressure process [33]. 
However, the technology producers are currently convinced that no 
additional infrared heater is required when the PCB enters the vacuum 
zone, because the body of the vacuum module is hot enough to radiate 
the heat onto the substrate and therefore onto the solder material. 

Diehm et al. [33] presumed that for the removal of voids, it is not the 
absolute vacuum pressure that is important, but much more the 
difference of pressure between void and environment. With this 
assumption, Klemm et al. [43] conducted a study in a laboratory scale, to 
investigate the effect of both process types of overpressure and vacuum 
with In-situ-X-ray-analysis. The results are demonstrating that 
overpressure Figure 8, c) reduces the solvent gaseous process significantly 
whereas vacuum Figure 8, b) accelerates it. The melting temperature of 
the solder is not affected by the pressure change, but the atmospheric 

17

pressure influences the boiling temperature of the solvent significantly. 
After melting the solder material, the overpressure profiles show a much 
higher amount of voids in the solder joint than the profiles with negative 
pressure.

For both vacuum and overpressure profiles, the number of voids does not 
change significantly during the pressure release. The observed 
phenomenon can be explained with Le Chatelier principle. This principle 
states that the application of pressure on a gas producing chemical 
reaction slows this reaction down. The higher the pressure, the slower the 
reaction gets. It means that vacuum process support the reduction of 
oxides by the flux and overpressure process hinders it. Therefore, vacuum

processes do always exhibit a better wetting behavior of the solder than 
conventional reflow or overpressure processes. According to Le Chatelier 
principle it is possible to control the speed of the flux reaction and 
thereby the intensity of gas production by controlling the atmospheric 
pressure [43]. The overpressure allows heating of assemblies with forced 
gas convection, with similar thermal behavior like standard reflow 
soldering and all its advantages, such as low temperature differences 
(delta T), good heat transfer and controlled heating process [33]. 
Moreover, outgassing materials and leaking components are not likely to 
result from a soldering process with elevated pressure. Less mechanical 
parts construction is needed to reach a high pressure range from 1–4 bar 
which can be released instantaneously to make voids leave the liquid 
solder depot [9] [33]. Hence, it is inferred that any of vacuum and 
overpressure processes for a void-free solder joint has advantages and 
disadvantages. The focus of this study yields on the soldering process with 
overpressure module. 

2.2 Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a 
Multi-Objective Optimization and Decision Making 
Method 

The classical project management is built on the trade-off theory for time, 
cost and quality, and it has been investigated as a decision making tool 
vastly in construction management and project scheduling [44] [45] [46] 
as well as for manufacturing operation [47] [48]. An approach to provide 
compromise solutions in the trade-off is using the multi-objective 
algorithms. The solution methods can be categorized into three main 
groups, namely, (1) mathematical algorithms, (2) heuristic algorithms, and 
(3) evolutionary algorithms. Among these groups, evolutionary algorithms 
and artificial intelligence are the most favorable ones because of the fact 
that they are capable to deal with more than one objective, easily achieve 
diverse solutions in complex problems compared to the other algorithms 
[49].  

Another approach for a decision making situation is to find the trade-off 
between the criteria. The decision making is considered as a problem with 
a finite set of projects, a finite set of criteria, and set of evaluations of 
projects with respect to all criteria. In this case, the decision projects are 
evaluated with respect to three criteria: the project completion time, total 
cost, and quality. The solution of multiple criterion decision making 

19 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

problems is possible if the decision maker is able to provide information 
of his preferences with respect to the set of objectives and consideration.  

To build cumulative and lasting manufacturing capability, enhancement 
should be designed first towards enhancing the time efficiency, shorted 
lead-time and minimum cost, then while the efforts to enhance time 
efficiency are further expanded, attention should be paid to improve the 
quality [50]. While efforts on the previous two are further enhanced, 
direct attention can be paid to energy efficiency [51]. Energy efficiency is a 
recent topic highly raised in the attentions which completes the 
conventional trade-off model and it is addressing the resources as energy 
and material which are consumed in a manufacturing process. Therefore, 
as shown in Figure 9, the energy is used as the fourth criterion in the 
decision making trade-off model [1] [52]. 

 
Figure 9: Extended project management trade-off in manufacturing operation [52] [53] 

In manufacturing companies the performance of each criterion is 
controlled by the operation controlling department. The fulfillment of the 
goals of the company is evaluated and controlled with the help of 
operation performance indicators. Indicators are crucial performance 
parameters that represent a specific value over a defined period or unit. 
Table 1 shows the measured factors, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), 
Management Information System (MIS) and Unique Selling Proposition 
(USP) as evaluation factors for different trade-off criteria of the extended 
trade-off model [1] [53]. At each level of transparency, there are indicators 
for evaluation and control which are defined per each criterion. For the 
measurement there are quantifiable definitions such as production lead-
time, material costs, delivery quality or electrical energy consumption. For 
KPI level, quantifying the relevant proportion per part is illustrating the 
performance of criteria. In this level, part is chosen as an indicating unit 
however further dentitions such any value-added benefit could be also 
utilized upon the requirements of performance evaluation. MIS provide 
the necessary information to the controlling department and enable a 

20

continuous improvement by using the information flow of process 
operation. USP is the factor or consideration presented by a seller as the 
reason that one product or service is different from and better than that of 
the competition.

2.2.1 Energy as a Crucial Criterion in Classical Trade-off 
Model 

Industrial activity, and in particular the manufacturing sector, has a large 
environmental burden associated with it. In the recent years, 
manufacturing companies started to change their production to produce 
more resource efficient. This is not only caused by the rising energy 
expenses and the increasing environmental awareness, but also by the 
German government energy policy. German manufacturing industries are 
responsible for about 47% of the total national energy consumption. This 
makes the energy efficiency in manufacturing systems not only a single 
company issue but also a national or even global challenge [54]. 

21 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

Therefore, the Co2 emissions reduction target of at least 40% in 2022 for 
Germany is impossible to reach without involving the industry sector [55]. 
Due to these facts, since recent years the German government offered 
several research programs and incentives to reduce energy consumption 
in manufacturing sectors.  

For instance, several research projects have been launched to reduce the 
energy consumption in manufacturing industries. EniPROD (Energy 
Efficient Production Processes) project, which is coordinated by the 
Technical University of Chemnitz, is aiming is to increase the resource 
efficiency of the production processes [56]. The SimEnergy project is 
aiming to predict and optimize the energy usage in automobile industry 
using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) approaches [57]. EnEffaH (Energy 
Efficiency in Production in the Drive and Handling Technology Field), is 
conducted by the Institute for System Dynamics, University of Stuttgart, 
and it is developing methods, tools and products for an energy efficient 
automation [58]. Further above, to handle the flexibility of energy sources, 
the Bavarian Research Foundation provided grants for the project 
FOREnergy which is aiming to define concepts and solutions for energy 
flexibility in production. This project started in 2012 and is conducted by 
several research institutes and partners from industry within the Free 
State of Bavaria [59]. Further collaborative project granted by the Free 
State of Bavaria is so-called Green Factory Bavaria (GFB). This project 
involves several universities and industries in Bavaria (e.g. University of 
Erlangen-Nuremberg, Technical University of Munich, University of 
Applied Sciences Nuremberg, Fraunhofer Institute, and industry partners 
such as Siemens AG and Audi AG, etc.). The core objective of this project 
is the transfer of knowledge from applied research to industries (mainly 
small and medium sized companies) to increase energy and resource 
efficiency of manufacturing processes. To achieve this objective the 
"Green Factories" in Bavaria are constructed as a demonstration, learning 
and research platform. Both technical solutions and methodology are 
developed to reduce energy consumption in production processes [60]. 

The premier requirement of energy efficiency in manufacturing is to apply 
methods to transparent the energy consumption along the manufacturing 
chain. An important part of reducing the energy demand is to effectively 
measure, calculate, and evaluate the efficiency of production flow in order 
to realize the optimization potentials. The DIN EN ISO 9000:2005 defines 
efficiency as follows: "the relationship between the result achieved and 
the resources used." Following this standard definition, energy efficiency 
represents the ratio of consumed energy (e.g. kWh) to the generated 

22 



2.2   Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a Multi-Objective Optimization and 
Decision Making Method 

 
 
benefits (e.g. units produced or value). It corresponds to the productivity 
that describes the ratio of produced goods (output) to the consumed 
production resources (inputs) [6]. Another possibility for the definition of 
energy efficiency in manufacturing is the ratio of the real productivity to 
the ideal productivity. Here, the question is answered of how the actual 
produced goods (e.g. the amount) correspond with the defined energy 
input, i.e. the possible number under ideal conditions [61]. 

Several strategies are deployed to transparent and control the energy flow 
of manufacturing processes. As an example in a broader perspective for 
Manufacturing Execution System (MES) [62], a strategy is developed in 
which each process is segmented into specific manufacturing operations 
with a specific energy consumption which is so-called EnergyBlocks [63].  
As shown in Figure 10, the energy profile of every manufacturing machine, 
such as the machining center or transport system, is considered as input 
data for a defined segment.  

 
Figure 10: Energy consumption in manufacturing chain blocks [63] 

To identify the energy saving potentials, the optimization of the 
manufacturing sequences are necessary. The key factors to achieve 
accurate EnergyBlocks data are the data sources and the information flow 
of the energy profile of every manufacturing machine. The collection, 
visualization [64] and analysis of the data either could be conducted by 
modeling and simulation [54] [65], or by mathematical modeling [63]. 
Such approaches are designed to assist engineers for planning and 
scheduling handling or assembly processes in order to optimize their 
energy consumption.

2.2.2 Energy Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) enable manufacturing companies to 
keep track of the continuous improvement of a production system, and it 
avoids uncertainty in the calculations. These KPIs should be defined from 
the lean concept perspective. The philosophy of lean concept puts the 
emphasis on the needs of the customers and aims at enhancing 
productivity. The objective is to create as much value for the customer as 
possible and continuously improve the value-creating activities. Thus, it is 
a key to identify what brings value to the customer, and focus on these 
activities connected to the production of the product or the features the 
customer is willing to pay for. All other activities are considered as non-
value adding steps and referred to as waste. The lean concept reveals 
bottlenecks, unnecessary activities and optimization potential in order to 
reduce waste and improve lead-time of production [66]. Hence, 
quantitatively measuring performance to enable accurate and detailed 
analyses is essential when it comes to manage the lean Continuous 
Improvement Process (CIP) [67].  

KPIs are crucial performance parameters that represent a specific value 
over a defined period, and they simply track the values of interest and can 
be reported in order to show, for instance, deviations above a certain 
norm [67]. Likewise, for resource efficiency, benchmarking, and energy 
KPIs in general, is a promising method of comparison that searches for 
solutions among the strongest competitors and can be used in almost 
every production unit. KPIs can be used for a comparison of resource 
efficiency, however, only from specific perspectives. As shown in Figure 11 
for the operation processes, the measures should be identified which 
illustrate the value-added energy into a specific process. Not only the 
quantity but also the quality of applied energy and resources should be 
investigated. To do so, the measures and energy indicators should be 
defined. No instrument for the overall assessment of the energy efficiency 
in the production exists, mainly because no precise energetic reference 
points are used or indeed do not yet exist. 

 
Figure 11: Realization of the measures for energy saving potential 

24 



2.2   Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a Multi-Objective Optimization and 
Decision Making Method 

 
 
Kreitlein et al. [68] [69] developed a KPI method to show how the energy 
efficiency can be compared and evaluated during the production of 
various products. The aim is assessment and evaluation of energy 
efficiency of the manufacturing processes in the production from the 
perspective of production planning. Figure 12 illustrate a model for energy 
efficiency KPIs which was initially developed to quantify the amount of 
consumed energy for the least energy demand [68]. Further on, the model 
is developed to investigate the thermodynamic complexity of a production 
process [70].  

 
Figure 12: KPIs for energy efficiency of production levels [70] 

To quantify the energy efficiency, the least energy demand method is 
evaluating the energy consumption based on the ratio of the theoretically 
required electrical energy consumption to the measured electrical energy 
consumption. Due to its independent comparison basis, the least energy 
demand method allows for process, product, company, and even cross-
industry comparisons. Thus, by means of using KPIs on all levels of the 
manufacturing process, the method follows the basic intention of making 
the energy efficiency of a product transparent and ultimately comparable. 
However, these KPIs in the production process level provide metrics to 
evaluate the quantity of electrical energy consumption and resources and 
not the quality of how the resources are consumed in the process. 

The quality of resource consumption can be described as the amount of 
work that can be obtained from a specific amount of available energy. 

25 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

Thermodynamics provide metrics based on both the first and the second 
law of thermodynamics to evaluate the quality of energy transformation 
in a system. Exergy describes the available energy and the exergy analysis 
identifies the waste of usable energy. The exergy analysis will be used as 
energy KPI in this study to evaluate the thermodynamic interaction of the 
used resources in the soldering oven technology. 

2.2.3 The 1st Constraint: Exergy Efficiency Analysis to 
Evaluate the Energy Criterion 

Exergy analysis is a tool to realize the minimum energy required doing the 
work, and this is used as an indicator in the tetrahedron trade-off model. 
In thermodynamics, exergy is defined as the usable amount of work that 
can be obtained from a system when it is taken from its current state of 
thermodynamic balance with the environment, which means exergy is the 
usable part of energy. An investigation of the energy and resource 
efficiency is usually performed with a statistical evaluation, however for 
complex thermal processes exergy methods are established [71]. Since the 
application of energy methods only involves the 1st law of 
thermodynamics and therefore ignore the difference between work and 
heat, these methods lack factors such as the application of material 
balances, energy balances and equilibrium relationships, which are 
required to adequately show effectiveness of the system utilizing given 
energy resources. While energy cannot be destroyed according to the first 
law of thermodynamics, exergy can be destroyed. The destroyed part is 
called anergy and cannot be converted back into exergy. Exergy method is 
also driven from the 2nd law of thermodynamics and it is defined as “The 
maximum theoretical useful work (shaft work or electrical work) 
obtainable as the system is brought into complete thermodynamic 
equilibrium with the thermodynamic environment while the system 
interacts with this environment only” [72]. The analysis is obtaining also 
the exergy loss or exergy destruction of the process, and it is indicating 
that the increase of entropy in a process is proportional to the destruction 
of exergy [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78]. 

Despite the fact that energy efficiency is currently the most common tool 
to measure the effectiveness of a process, it might be misleading since it 
does not assess the energy quality. Another method to analyze the 
efficiency based on the second law of thermodynamics is entropy analysis. 
Because entropy analysis delivers results in Joules per temperature 
change, the exergy analysis delivers its results in energy units and it 

26 



2.2   Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a Multi-Objective Optimization and 
Decision Making Method 

 
 
enables to compare the interaction of any source of energies in the 
system. The analysis cannot differ between a resource and waste, and it is 
identifying and quantifying the types, causes and locations of the losses. 
Despite the advantages of exergy analysis, it also has some demerits, as 
the selection of the reference environment is crucial for the analysis [79]. 

The flexibility of exergy analysis is shown by the large range of fields it has 
been applied in: industrial systems, evolution theory, social theory, 
economics, and environmental impact of systems, sustainability, policy 
and decision making. In the industrial systems emphasis has been placed 
on applying exergy to sustainability science [80] including studies on the 
investigation of the relationship between exergy and sustainability and 
eco-efficiency in manufacturing processes [81], and the critical 
environmental impact indicators [7]. The common areas of exergy 
analysis application are mainly in energy intensive systems such as power 
generation, thermal systems [82], steel industry [83], textile production 
[84] and a review of the use of exergy in cement manufacturing is given in 
[85]. According to the basis set by Gyftopoulos and Beretta [74], exergy 
analysis can be applied to any ‘well-defined’ system in any state in 
manufacturing processes as well. The analysis ranging from conventional 
ones such as machining, casting and molding [86] to advanced processes 
like PCB assembly production [87], and vapor phase soldering process 
[88]. 

Exergy model construction 

Before proceeding to the exergy analysis and setting up the specific exergy 
equations, an understanding of how to balance the exergy is mandatory. 
For an energy balance in a steady state condition the input energy 
(𝐸 (𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡)) has to be the same as the output energy (𝐸 (𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡)), since 
energy will neither be created nor destroyed during any kind of process 

∆𝐸
(Eq. 1). Under steady state conditions (0 = ) net energies flowing 

∆𝑡
(?̇? (𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡)) in and out (?̇? (𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡)) are equal. 

                                              𝐸 (𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡) = 𝐸 (𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡)                                     (1)         

To transform the energy balance to an exergy balance, the destruction of 
exergy has to be taken into account, and the exergy flowing into the 
system is not the same as the exergy flowing out. The destroyed exergy is 
the difference between the exergy input and the exergy output (Eq. 2). 
The exergy output indicates the exergy that has not been destroyed 
during the process and could theoretically produce work [89]. Due to the 
irreversibility of the process, some of the input exergy is always consumed 

27 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

and destroyed. The exergy loss is the result of friction, diffusion, 
throttling, combustion processes, absorption or emission of thermal 
radiations. Only in an ideal, isentropic environment the exergy 
destruction would be zero [90].  

               𝐸𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 (𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡) = 𝐸𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 (𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑑)  +  𝐸𝑥𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 (𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡)    (2) 

Since exergy destruction is proportional to the entropy created by the 
process, losses always occur. So the difference between exergy input and 
exergy output is the exergy loss (𝐸?̇?𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠). It can be calculated as the 
product of entropy generated (∆𝑆) and the environmental temperature 
(𝑇0) (Eq. 3). All other losses, such as unutilized resource flows out of the 
system, contribute to the exergy loss. 

                𝐸?̇?𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = 𝑇0 ∙ ∆𝑆           (3) 

As a result, the exergy destruction (𝐸?̇?𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠) is the difference between the 
exergy input into the system (𝐸?̇?𝑖𝑛) and the exergy that flows out of the 
system (𝐸?̇?𝑜𝑢𝑡) (Eq. 4).  

                                 𝐸?̇?𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = 𝐸?̇?𝑖𝑛 − 𝐸?̇?𝑜𝑢𝑡                                  (4) 

As different forms of energy have different qualities, therefore exergy 
input and exergy output can have different forms. It can be distinguished 
between the exergy of the work 𝐸?̇?𝑊, the exergy of heat 𝐸?̇?𝑄, and flow 
exergy 𝐸?̇?𝑖 which is the exergy carried by the material flow. Figure 13 
shows the exergy model construction and its components. Exergy model 
consists of physical and chemical exergy. The physical part comprises 
mechanical and thermomechanical exergy. Mechanical exergy consists of 
kinetic and potential exergy that are controversial in manufacturing 
systems. Thermochemical exergy comprises of temperature-based and 
pressure-based processes. It is addressing the reversible physical 
processes, and therefore this study is not including thermochemical 
exergy flow. The chemical part of exergy consists of mixing and separation 
as well as chemical reactions [74] [76]. 

28

Thus, the total exergy flow is composed as followed: 

        𝐸?̇? ̇
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 0 = ∆𝐸𝑥𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑠 +  ∆𝐸?̇?𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚 − 𝐸?̇?𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠         (5) 

In a steady state condition the total exergy flow 𝐸?̇?𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is zero. In the 
following, the compound of the total exergy flow is described in detail. 

The exergy of the work 

For mechanical (potential and kinetic) and electrical work, exergy flow is 
equal to energy (Eq. 6 and Eq. 7). This means that, under ideal conditions, 
work flow (?̇?) could be obtained completely without loss and zero 
friction [91].

                           𝐸?̇?𝑘𝑖𝑛 = 𝐸 = 𝑚(𝜈2 − 𝜈2)

The exergy flow of work (𝐸?̇?𝑊) flowing into the system is equal to the 
total of the energy (work) available (Eq. 8). 

          𝐸?̇?𝑊 = 𝐸 = ?̇?                       (8) 

Heat flow (?̇?), on the other hand, is a form of energy that is not fully 
available to be transformed into work. The exergy flow of heat (𝐸?̇?𝑄) 
flowing in or out of the system can be determined in regard to the 
Carnot’s theorem between the temperature of a given state (𝑇𝑖) and the 
environmental temperature (𝑇0) (Eq.9).

The Carnot coefficient describes the maximum possible efficiency when 
transforming heat into usable work [91]. As explained, exergy consists of 
chemical and physical exergy. Thermomechanical exergy is not deployed 
which is applicable for reversible processes. The relevance and the 
calculations are illustrated below. 

Physical Exergy 

Physical exergy consists of mechanical and thermomechanical exergy. As 
mechanical exergy in form of kinetic and potential exergy, as described in 
equation 6 and 7, equals the total quantity of available work, the 
thermomechanical exergy is a function of entropy (𝑆) and enthalpy (𝐻) 
from the material at a given state. Therefore, the physical exergy is the 
maximum available energy in a system until it is brought into equilibrium 
with the environment. Enthalpy represents the energy content in thermal 
energy, where entropy describes its unavailability. This results in the fact, 
that increasing temperature increases the enthalpy of a material flow but 
also the entropy, which has a reducing effect on the exergy [76] [92]. 
Accordingly to equation 10, the deltas of entropy and enthalpy at a given 
state and the environmental state express the physical exergy (or the 
enthalpy flow 𝐸?̇?𝐻) of a material flowing into, or out of the system.  

                                    𝐸?̇?𝐻 = ∆𝐻 − 𝑇0∆𝑆                                            (10) 

As shown in equation 11 and equation 12, the enthalpy difference consists 
of the specific heat constant 𝑐𝑝 and the temperature difference between 
the ambient temperature 𝑇0 and the temperature 𝑇i at a given state. The 
heat constant 𝑐𝑝 is considered to be constant during the entire soldering 
process. For the entropy difference, there is a distinction between 
gaseous, liquid and solid substances. While for gaseous substances, the 
universal gas constant 𝑅 is used, other substances use the specific volume 
𝑣. Both equations utilize the pressure difference between the origin 𝑃0 
and the given state 𝑃1 [76].

Chemical Exergy 

Chemical exergy is the maximum useful energy, by means of chemical 
processes, when the stream is not in a chemical equilibrium. Under 

30 



2.2   Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a Multi-Objective Optimization and 
Decision Making Method 

 
 
predefined environmental conditions, materials and material 
compositions have specific chemical exergies (𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑖 , 𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑗), such as 
like the standard chemical exergy by Szargut [93]. If a material specific 
chemical exergy is not given in any table, it can be calculated using the 
Gibbs free energy (∆𝐺°

𝑓) (Eq. 13). The Gibbs free energy is a basic concept 
of chemical engineering and available in tables for various substances 
[94]. For atmospheric gases (such as nitrogen) the dead state would be 
the atmosphere and the mole fractions 𝑋𝑖 of the gas (nitrogen). The 
specific chemical exergy for atmospheric gases (𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝐴𝑇𝑀𝑔𝑎𝑠) depends on 
the reference temperature and the local atmospheric mole fraction 
𝑋𝑒𝑖  (Eq. 14). 

   𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑖𝑗 = 𝜀 °
𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑖 + 𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑗 + ∆𝐺𝑓                                     (13) 

     𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝐴𝑇𝑀𝑔𝑎𝑠 = −𝑅𝑇0 ln 𝑋
𝑒
𝑖                                               (14) 

The chemical exergy of incompressible substances, such as water, 
depends on the specific volume 𝑣 of the material and the pressure 
difference to the reference state and also the relative humidity 𝜑 (Eq. 15).  

          𝜀𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 =  𝑣(𝑃𝐴𝑇𝑀 − 𝑃𝑆𝐴𝑇)  − 𝑅 𝑇0ln𝜑                    (15) 

In general, the difference of chemical exergy of a substance can be derived 
from the chemical potential µ𝑖 at the given state and the chemical 
potential µ0. In regard to the mole fraction 𝑋𝑒𝑖  and the difference of the 
chemical potentials the specific chemical exergy can be calculated as 
shown in equation 16.  

                                     𝜀 𝑒
𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚,𝑖 = (µ𝑖 − µ0)𝑋𝑖            (16) 

Since for most substances either the specific chemical exergy value or the 
Gibbs free energy of the formation exists in tables [93] [94], a more 
detailed explanation on chemical exergy will be referred to the referenced 
literatures [74]. 

2.2.4 The 2nd Constraint: The Production Lead-time to 
Evaluate the Time Criterion 

The time criterion in this study is conceived as the production lead-time. 
The production lead-time is defined as the time an object needs to pass 
through a system. The setup time is the time, which is necessary to 
prepare the work. While those two criterion define indicators within the 
company, the delivery time includes the contact with the customer, as the 
time from the incoming order to the goods delivery [53] [95]. Likely, the 

31 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

study is discussing the soldering process that is part of the electronics 
assembly production, and hence the delivery time is not considered. 
Furtherly, the focus is on production lead-time of a PCB product, when it 
enters and leaves the soldering oven technology. 

2.2.5 The 3rd Constraint: Economic Perspective to Evaluate 
the Cost Criterion 

Several approaches are reported for the cost analysis in manufacturing 
companies. Götze, U. [96] defined an economic classification according to 
the type of goods and consumption as shown in Table 2. Because this 
study is focusing on the boundaries during the production lead-time of a 
PCB product, therefore, the analysis are not addressing the non-short-
term consumptions, and not the cost for the amortizations, risk costs, 
taxes, or interest rates.  

Table 2: Classification of cost categories according to type of goods and consumption [96]  

When looking at the short-term consumption, only the consumption of 
process-related material goods, resources, electrical energy consumption 
are relevant. The cost for personal cost, external services and the cost for 
legal interest remain unchanged. The change of solder profiles is 
associated with the variation of production lead-time and therefore it is 
influencing further alterations in energy and material consumption cost. 

2.2.6 The 4th Constraint: Solder Joint Defects to Evaluate the 
Quality Criterion 

The solder joint quality is realized as the quality criterion in the trade-off 
model. It determines the joint durability and reliability, and it can be 

32 



2.2   Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a Multi-Objective Optimization and 
Decision Making Method 

 
 
influenced by many factors, among which material ageing, mechanical 
stress and thermal stress are the most important. When inspected 
visually, there are three criteria to evaluate the solder joint quality: The 
wetting of the solder pad and the electronics components metallization, 
the shape of the solder joint and the condition of the solder surface. 
During the production of electronic devices, various solder joint defects 
can occur. Those solder joint defects are all listed in the IPC-A-610D, 
which contains worldwide-standardized acceptance criteria for electronic 
assemblies. It features acceptance criteria for all kinds of solder joints and 
divides the finished electronics in three classes [37]: 

 Class 1: General electronic products – Main requirement is the 
functioning of the finished electronic 

 Class 2: Dedicated service electronic products – Correct 
functioning, extended durability and uninterruptible service is 
required, but not critical 

 Class 3: High performance electronic products – Continuous 
high performance or vital material supply is required and critical 

The criteria are mainly dependent on the quality of soldering process. 
Special solder surfaces also require special acceptance criteria. The criteria 
should be based on design, process capability and performance 
requirements. The solder should achieve a good wetting and form a 
shallow edge at the to-be-soldered parts. In the end, the parts contour 
should still be well visible. Since the optimum cannot always be realized, 
the IPC-A-610D mentions still acceptable criteria in addition to the 
quality goals. The still accepted criteria cover tolerated deviations in 
looks, wetting angle of contact and contour visibility. The guideline also 
differs between leaded and lead-free solder joints. In the following, 
frequent solder joint defects caused by the soldering process and their 
respective countermeasures are introduced [37]. This study is addressing 
the high quality solder joint which could be used for the high-tech 
products. Hence, the zero-void solder joint is aimed as the main quality 
measure. A void ratio of 30% or less is acceptable according to 
IPC-A-610D, but for high-performance electronic devices, it should be 
even less and under 5% which is the main objective of the quality 
criterion for the multi-objective process optimization.

2.3 Computational Intelligence for Process 
Optimization  

The volume of data analytics and artificial intelligence grows fast in 
modern manufacturing establishes the new research expert programs [97] 
and new applications in industry [98] [99] [100]. The new digital 
production environments, which exploit technologies such as barcodes, 
sensors, control systems and vision systems in data acquisition [101]. The 
data can contain information about design, production, machines, 
processes, materials or quality. It is stored in databases and often not 
analyzed because of its large volume or missing values. Modern 
electronics process equipment can be used to store data whose flexible 
exploitation is, however, laborious to process experts. It is typical for the 
production of electronics that practically the only operation using the 
historical process data is the Statistical Process Control (SPC) [102] [103] 
[104], whereas the proactive operations for process improvement, such as 
diagnostics and optimization [19] [105] [106], often lack this valuable and 
abundant information. In other words, process equipment is regularly 
used in the production without a thorough analysis of the data that is, or 
at least could be, stored during the process. Due to the increasing amount 
of data and technical advances in information technology and computer 
systems, the process experts need also new and better instruments for 
process analysis and modeling. The key, in this respect, are automated 
diagnostics and optimization systems that enable fast and easy access to 
process data [107]. 

To enable a systematic analysis approach, a broad range of computational 
methods is used to analyze and improve processes. The used models vary 
from simple regression models to complex advanced models. The simple 
methods are used for analysis, as they are fast and easy to understand and 
implement. The complex methods are used for difficult optimization 
problems. If there is only a single optimization objective, the variable is 
focused. Multi-objective optimization on the other hand do not result in 
unique optimal solutions, but in optimum ranges for the used variables, 
the so-called Pareto optimality [108] [109]. The multi-objective 
optimization methods, as illustrated in Figure 14, can be divided in the 
categories no-preference methods, a posteriori methods, a priori methods 
and interactive methods. No-preference methods do not consider the 
opinion of the decision maker and are therefore used when the decision 
maker does not have any special requirements. A posteriori methods are 
used to generate Pareto optimal solutions, which is often computationally 

34 



2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization 
 
 

expensive and difficult. The results are presented to the decision maker 
who selects the most preferred alternative. For a priori methods, the 
decision maker has to specify his preferences before the solving process, 
which is difficult as the decision maker does not always know what is 
possible and realistic. For the interactive methods, the analyst and the 
decision maker work in cooperation. This has the advantage that only 
part of the Pareto optimal points has to be generated and evaluated [110]. 

 
Figure 14: Classification of multi-objective optimization methods [110]  

Moreover, the recent applications for computational intelligence has 
produced new intelligent methods for automated extraction of useful 
information [111]. Methods such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy sets, 
rough sets and evolutionary computation, which are generally associated 
with computational intelligence [112] [113] [114] [115] [116], are nowadays 
widely used in different industrial environments. Computational 
intelligence is the study of the design of intelligent agents. What it does is 
appropriate for its circumstances and its goal, it is flexible to changing 
environments and changing goals, it learns from experience, and it makes 
appropriate choices given perceptual limitations and finite computation 
[117]. Computational intelligence is the base concept with respect to 
machine learning. Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms 
that improve automatically through experience. The definition 
emphasizes the use of computer algorithms in learning and especially the 
adaptivity, or the ability to improve, of these algorithms. The main goal of 
the entire concept is thus to create algorithms that utilize past experience, 
or example data, in solving problems [118]. These methods include 
decision-based learning algorithms, and methods such artificial neural 
networks helps to learn from the past experiences, diagnose the problems 
and predict the future events in production processes.

2.3.1 Intelligent Process Optimization Methods for Soldering 
Process in High-Volume Electronics Production  

Since last years, there have been many studies carried out on the 
monitoring of reflow soldering process and improvement of soldering 
process quality. Most of these studies have adopted qualitative defect 
mechanism analysis and computational simulation models for upgrading 
the soldering quality through keeping the actual profile at the specified 
target level [24]. Three commonly used methods have been implemented 
to achieve this objective [119]:  

 Thermal simulation modeling: a computational model with 
process specifications is used to simulate the shape of the reflow 
thermal profile. The simulation is performed iteratively until the 
results agree with the predefined specifications or the shape of the 
target thermal profile. The final recipe(s) will be used as the oven 
machine setup [26] [120] [121]. 

 SPC method: the ingredients of a reflow thermal profile (e.g. setup 
peak temperature, soaking temperature, preheating slope, and so 
on) are monitored by traditional control charts with predefined 
limits to diagnose and identify any variability in the reflow 
soldering process and reduce the need for post-reflow inspections 
[122]. 

 Computational intelligence approach: the computational 
intelligence approaches are designated to acquire knowledge of 
the essential factors that influence the performance of the reflow 
soldering process. Specifications are considered to deduce the 
most acceptable recipes for achieving homogeneous temperature 
distribution in soldering process [123]. 

Computational intelligence approaches in electronics manufacturing is 
fast growing. Traditionally, the used methods in process improvement 
through data-driven analysis were statistical linear methods or 
experimental testing [102] [124]. Liukkonen et al. [109], have conducted a 
complete review on the application of computational intelligence in mass 
soldering of electronics. The earliest intelligent applications to mass 
soldering originate from the early 1990s, including the application of 
methods such as multilayer perceptron, probabilistic neural networks, 
self-organizing maps, fuzzy logic and also the first hybrid methods. As a 
matter of fact, at the beginning of the 1990s the research has been quite 
active in this field, whereas a reduction can be seen in the published 

36 



2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization 
 
 

literature at the turn of the century. Nonetheless, it seems that the range 
of computational methods has been widened in the 21st century as new 
methods such as support vectors machines, rough sets, decision trees and 
genetic algorithms have become a part of the research. More than 60% of 
all studies were about application of these methods in inspection of solder 
joints and quality management issues. Shown in Figure 15, multilayer 
perceptron have been the mostly used intelligent method, covering 
approximately 50% of the applications. Applications of self-organizing 
maps, fuzzy methods and hybrid methods have also been reported but the 
use of methods other than these has been only marginal. 82% of the 
applications utilize Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (feedforward artificial 
neural network models), if the applications of hybrid methods are 
included. The main conclusion proves the recent trends of applications of 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in electronic packaging comparing with 
other computationally intelligent methods explained comprehensively 
explained by Liukkonen et al. [109].

Comparing with other mathematical optimization methods, ANN require 
less formal statistical training and it can also implicitly detect complex 
relations between independent and dependent variables. Another 
advantage is the ability to detect all possible interactions between the 
predictor variables. Additionally, it can be developed using various 
training algorithms, and hence it is relatively easy to use. On the opposite 
side, ANN method work like a black box and it has a limited ability to

identify possible causal relationships. In addition, the application of this 
method in some fields is also very difficult. Despite their simple usage, 
they require greater computational resources than other methods. In 
addition to that, they are vulnerable to overfitting, which distorts the 
results. Another disadvantage is the requirement of enough training data 
if the algorithm obtaining an over-fitted results [125] [126] [127]. 

2.3.2 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Principle and 
Applications Biological Neural Networks 

Artificial neural networks are used to capture a relationship between 
variables which are difficult to relate analytically. They have the ability to 
learn and to be trained for certain tasks. Thereby, ANNs try to imitate the 
human brain learning process of biological neuron which is shown in 
Figure 16. By using neurotransmitters, coded information is sent from the 
synapses to the axon and the axon transmits the information to other 
neurons. 100 billion interconnected neurons are organized in groups and 
subsystems and altogether form the brain [128] [129]. The principle of 
information handling in brain were used, mathematically modeled, and 
deployed in industry application for data analytics.  

 
Figure 16: Simplified model of a biological neuron [130] 

Mathematical modelling of neural network  

According to Figure 17, ANN is a structure which is able to receive input 
vector 𝐼 = [𝑖1, 𝑖2, … , 𝑖𝑛], and generate appropriate output vector  
𝑂 = [𝑜1, 𝑜2, … , 𝑜𝑚] [131]. The  ANN  contains  several  connected  
elementary  calculation  units,  which  are  called  neurons. The structure 

38 



2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization 
 
 

shows a  schematic  representation  of  an   artificial  neuron  with  input  
vector  (with 𝑟 elements) and characteristic structure of the feed forward 
ANN with 𝑘 hidden layers. Each  of  the  input  elements 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑟 is  
multiplied  with  the  corresponding  weight  of  the   connection 
𝑤𝑖,1, 𝑤𝑖,2, … , 𝑤𝑖,𝑟. The neuron sums these values and adds a bias 𝑏𝑖 (which 
is not present in all networks). The argument of the function (which is 
called transfer function) is given as follows [132]: 

                           𝑎𝑖 = 𝑥1𝑤𝑖,1 + 𝑥2𝑤𝑖,2 +⋯+ 𝑥𝑟𝑤𝑖,𝑟 + 𝑏𝑖                              (17) 

while neuron produces output: 

𝑟
                             𝑦𝑖 = 𝑓(𝑎𝑖) = 𝑓 (∑ 𝑥𝑗𝑤𝑖,𝑗 + 𝑏𝑖)                              (18) 

𝑗=1

This output represents an input to the neurons of another layer, or an 
element of the output vector of the ANN. The whole system is perceived 
as parallel because many neurons can implement calculations 
simultaneously. The most important feature of a neural network is the 
structure of the connected neurons because it determines the way the 
calculations are performed. Apart from the source layer that receives the 
inputs and the output layer on which the input layer is mapped, a neural 
network can have one or more intermediate hidden layers. Furthermore, 
the types of interneuron connections determine the characteristics of a 
network and consequently the tasks for which it is designed to be used. 

In feed forward networks, data run exclusively from the input units to the 
output units while in recurrent networks, feedback connections act 
beneficially for the training process and the behavior of the network. 
Finally, the algorithm used for the network training affects its 
performance and effectiveness. The training of neural networks refers to 
the procedure adopted to achieve a desired behavior by modifying the 
synaptic weights, which allows them to learn from their environment and 
improve their performance through time. The various methods of 
adjusting the connections weights constitute different training 
algorithms. Each algorithm comprises a well-defined set of rules for 
solving the training problem and has specific advantages and 
disadvantages. Depending on the environment of the neural network, 
three different training methods may be distinguished, namely 
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised 
learning, the training is based on examples of desired behavior. The 
parameters are adjusted according to the training vector and the error 

39 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

signal between the target values (𝑡(𝑘)) and predicted values (𝑦(𝑘)) of 
the network outputs [133]. 

 
Figure 17: Artificial neuron and the structure of the feed forward artificial neural network 
[132] 

The adjustment of parameters is implemented with an error correction 
algorithm. It must be pointed out that typical supervised learning neural 
networks are the feed forward and the radial basis function networks. On 
the other hand, in unsupervised learning the weights are modified in 
response to network inputs only. There are no target outputs available. 
Most of these learning algorithms perform clustering operations. They 
categorize the input patterns into a finite number of classes. This is 
especially useful in applications such as vector quantization. Finally, 
reinforcement learning trains the network with the use of a feedback 
signal called reinforcement signal, which ‘‘awards’’ the right behavior or 
‘‘punishes’’ the wrong behavior of the network. It can be easily understood 
that the network receives only a training data set without the respective 
desired outputs and during the training, it tries to find a set of weights 
that tend to avoid negative reinforcement signals. 

Backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm 

Backpropagation (BP) algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that 
adapts the synaptic weights, aiming to minimize the Mean Squared Error 
(MSE) between the desired and the actual network outputs after each 
input vector presentation. Backpropagation (BP) ANNs are the most 
common than any other kind of networks [134]. Feed-forward perceptrons 
could be trained with various backpropagation algorithms, such 

40 



2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization 
 
 

Conjugate gradient backpropagation, the backpropagation Levenberg–
Marquardt algorithm, the backpropagation Bayesian algorithm, and 
adaption learning function such as adaptive backpropagation algorithm of 
the steepest descent. Such networks with one or more hidden layers are 
the Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). These networks, unlike simple 
perceptron, are capable of classifying linearly inseparable patterns and 
can solve complicated problems. They are trained with backpropagation 
algorithms and the transfer function employed is a differentiable sigmoid 
function like hyperbolic tangent [133]. 

Standard backpropagation is a gradient descent algorithm in which the 
network weights are moved along the negative of the gradient of the 
performance function. The main idea of the algorithm is that the errors of 
the hidden layers are specified by the backpropagation of the output 
neurons errors. The algorithm includes a forward and a backward phase. 
During the forward phase the input signals ‘‘travel’’ through the network 
from input to output, layer by layer, generating eventually a certain 
response and during the backward phase the error signals are back 
propagated, from the output layer to the input layer resulting in the 
adjustment of the network parameters by minimizing the Mean Squared 
Error (𝑚𝑠𝑒). Therefore, the synaptic weights are adjusted to minimize the 
criterion according to equation 19.

𝑄 𝑄

where:  𝑄 – number of experiments,  𝑒(𝑘)  – error,  𝑡(𝑘) – target values, 
𝑦(𝑘)  – predicted values 

For backpropagation algorithms, the weights are initialized with small 
random values and a random input pattern is chosen, which is propagated 
forward through the network. After the errors are calculated, the weights 
are updated. This procedure is repeated until the output error is below a 
certain threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached. 

Artificial Neural Network (ANN): state of the art in industry 

ANN has yet to have a quantitatively major impact on productivity growth 
in industry [135]. Besides present day industries are facing new challenges 
in terms of market demand and competition in various applications. ANN 
is recently changing known as Industry 4.0. The segments that the 
manufacturing companies see as offering the greatest potential for 
benefitting from the digital transformation to industry 4.0 include 
research and development (in which a total of 78% of companies see great 

41 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

or very great potential), warehousing and logistics (74%), production 
(73%), services (72%), procurement and purchasing (69%) and sales (56%) 
[136]. 

Integration of ANN with recent emerging technologies such as Industrial 
Internet of Things (IoT) [137] [138], big data analytics [139] [140] [141] [142], 
cloud computing [143] [144] and cyber physical systems [145] [146] will 
enable operation of industries in a flexible, efficient, and sustainable 
approach. The key elements in ANN application in industry can be 
characterized by the key elements include analytics technology, big data 
technology, cloud or cyber technology, domain knowhow and evidence. 
Analytics is the core of ANN, which can only bring value if other elements 
are present. Big data technology and cloud are both essential elements, 
which provide the source of the information and a platform. While these 
elements are essential, domain knowledge and evidence are also 
important factors that are mostly overlooked in this context. Domain 
knowhow is the key element from the following aspects: 1) understanding 
the problem and use the power of ANN in order to solving it; 2) 
understanding the system so that right data with the right quality can be 
collected; 3) understanding the physical meanings of the parameters and 
how they are associated with the characteristics of a system or process; 
and 4) understanding how these parameters are influencing the defined 
objectives. Evidence is also an essential element in validating ANN models 
and incorporates them with cumulative learning ability. By gathering data 
patterns and the evidence (or label) associated with those patterns can 
only we improve the ANN model to become more accurate and 
comprehensive [140]. 

ANN is recently applied extensively for prediction applications. One of 
the recent advancement trends for ANN application refer to autonomous 
vehicles (self-driving cars). Such vehicles combine a variety of sensors to 
perceive their surroundings, such as Lidar, sonar, radar, GPS and inertial 
measurement units [147]. Beyond that, they are equipped with computer 
(machine vision) that currently is one of the most prominent ANN 
technologies. Decision-based algorithms based on artificial intelligence 
used in autonomous transportation can substantially reduce the number 
of accidents and, as a result, reduce the number of fatalities. Also, ANN 
systems can contribute to achieving better and more accurate results in 
health diagnoses [148] [149]. Additionally, the implementation of simple 
robotics in companies may lead to noticeable savings, not to mention 
data-driven economy, where the use of ANN solutions plays a significant 
role [150]. This is a very promising area for European countries startups, 

42 



2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization 
 
 

especially in the financial, health sectors, and high-tech industries. In fact, 
the challenge of making industrial data accessible for reuse is as much 
imminent as it is inevitable. ANN is all about data-based innovation 
decision-making and prediction tools, when preparing regulatory impact 
assessment and this could create new demand in various applications in 
production industries [97].  

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling as a quality management 
tool in electronics production 

Despite the evident advantages and disadvantages of linear and statistical 
mathematical methods, the use of advanced nonlinear modeling methods, 
such as ANN, in the process analysis and optimization is mandatory in the 
electronics production assembly [151]. However, these methods are 
traditionally considered rather complicated and difficult to use which has 
limited the applicability of ANNs to real industrial problems. But this is 
changing, by the trend of development of expert and intelligent systems 
and data-driven applications in industry. Several studies support the fact 
that ANN method is a useful and effective means to exploit the process 
data [152] [153] [154].  ANNs can be used for various tasks. It can classify 
input patterns to pre-specified classes with feature vectors. With its 
clustering ability, data mining can be performed. Additionally, ANNs can 
be used to approximate functions. Another application of ANNs is the 
prediction ability that is used for the purpose of this work. 

Application of ANN method in soldering process has been mainly 
investigated for: (1) quality control and inspection of solder joints and, (2) 
quality management for analyzing, predicting and optimizing the 
soldering process profile [109]. Intelligent detection and diagnose of faulty 
solder joints is an important part of electronics production, because any 
flaws cause failures impeding the correct functioning of electronic 
products. Cho et al. [155], presented a variety of optical inspection systems 
processing based on neural networks for this purpose. Particularly 
multilayer perceptrons with backpropagation have been a popular 
method for inspection [156] [157] [158] [159] and classification of solder 
joints [160] [161]. Nevertheless, there are also applications based on self-
organizing maps and vector-based learning [162] [163], fuzzy logic  [164] 
[165], genetic algorithms [160] [119], and hybrid intelligence [13] [159].  

Quality management has been the main application field of intelligent 
methods with regard to mass soldering process of electronics assembly. 
Kusiak et al. [166] has investigated some best decision learning algorithms 
in machine learning and data mining of PCB defects. The earliest 

43

applications investigated the design factors of PCB assembly yield using 
both regression and neural network models trained with backpropagation 
[167]. Furthermore, Coit et al. [168] predicted soldering quality in wave 
soldering using a combination of production data and design of 
experiment data. A backpropagation algorithm and a network consisting 
of 13 input variables and two hidden layers were used to produce three 
outputs: excellent, good and fair solder quality. The results of the study 
were moderate, i.e. about 80% of classifications were correct, but it was 
beneficial that in erroneous cases the network predicted a higher defect 
level rather than a lower one. Yang et al. [169] implemented a neuro-fuzzy 
system for defect prediction and control of a surface mount assembly line. 
The system was able to identify all defects, but produced a few false 
alarms. The authors reported that the downtime inflicted by defects was 
reduced remarkably by 47% after implementing the system. Tseng et al. 
[170] used an extended approach based on the rough set theory to a 
problem of quality control in PCB assembly. They managed to predict 
97% of the solder balls, so the method overcame clearly the statistical 
methods used in their comparative studies.  

In the area of improving the product reliability, Lin et al. [171] created a 
predictive model for the sheer force of reflow soldered joints of ball grid 
array packages. Their system was based on integrated use of a multilayer 
feed forward neural network for modeling and sequential quadratic 
programming for optimization. Zhou et al. [172] combined a back 
propagating ANN with particle swarm optimization to optimize 
thermomechanical fatigue reliability of solder joints in Plastic Ball Grid 
Array (PBGA).  Liukkonen et al. [173] [174] exploited several investigations 
to test multiple linear regression and multilayer perceptron neural 
network to the variable selection in the wave soldering process profiles. 
They also proposed a model for variable selection of wave soldering 
process by using the overall cost of poor soldering quality as the model 
output. These systems can offer an advantageous automated tool for a 
quality engineer working for predictive quality management. 
Alternatively, the process engineers can exploit the system to process 
optimization in various manufacturing processes. Also, for the 
optimization of reflow soldering processes, BP algorithm is proposed to 
predict [175] and improve the optimum soldering temperature profile 
[176] [177], to improve the online control and Automatic Process Control 
(APC) [178], and to diagnose the technology setup parameters and 
predicting the output elements of a reflow temperature profile [119] [179].

2.3.3 Response Surface Method (RSM): Principle and 
Approach 

Response Surface Method (RSM) consists of various mathematical and 
statistical techniques. It is used to develop a functional relationship 
between a response of interest 𝑦 and a number of control variables 𝑥𝑘. In 
RSM, two important models are generally used to describe the functional 
relationships: the first-degree model (Eq. 20) and the second-degree 
model (Eq. 21). 𝜖 describes a random experimental error and 𝛽 is a vector 
of unknown constant parameters. 

                                 𝑦 =  𝛽0 + ∑𝑘
𝑖=1𝛽𝑖𝑥𝑖 + 𝜖                                                 (20) 

               𝑦 =  𝛽0 + ∑𝑘 𝑘 𝑘 2
𝑖=1𝛽𝑖𝑥𝑖 + ∑𝑖<𝑗∑𝛽𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑖𝑥𝑗 + ∑𝑖=1𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑥𝑖 + 𝜖                 (21) 

With these models, it is possible to establish a relationship between the 
variables which can be used to predict response values. Additionally, it 
can be used to determine the significance of variables and the optimum 
variable settings to achieve a certain goal. To set up the model, a series of 
Design of Experiments (DOEs) should be conducted first. The number of 
experiments in DOE should follow a 𝑛 ×  𝑘 design matrix, whereby 𝑛 is 
the number of different factors and 𝑘 is the number of control variables. 
Depending on the desired output, various design types can be used. For 
first-order models, the most common designs are 2k factorial, Plackett-
Burman and simplex designs. Plackett-Burman is a fractional factorial 
design based on main effects alone. It is a two level screening design that 
is used to identify significant factors that influence response. Response 
surface methodology is the follow up of Plackett-Burman or sometimes 
can be used standalone. It is full factorial design based on main, 
interaction and quadratic effects. It is three or five level design that is 
used to optimize significant factors identified by Plackett-Burman 
method. For second-order models, the most common designs are the 3k 
factorial (Full Factorial design), Central Composite and the Box-Behnken 
designs [180] [181] [182]. These designs are used for optimization purposes, 
and based on the objectives and cost saving factors, a design will be 
deployed. Because the Full Factorial design is considering every 
combination of factor levels, and therefore the experimental conduction is 
more costly and time taking rather Central Composite and the 
Box-Behnken designs [183]. To conduct the RSM approach as an 
optimization method, the following steps should be followed:  

1) Independent variables are selected which have major effects on 
the system. The vital variables from the many using a fractional 

45 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

factorial or Plackett-Burman design should be identified. These 
are dependent on the study objective and the researcher 
experience.  

2) The experimental design is chosen and executed according to the 
experimental matrix. When the experiments are finished, the 
experimental data is handled with mathematic-statistical 
treatment.  

3) The model fitness is evaluated and it is verified whether 
performing a displacement to the optimal region is possible 
and/or necessary.  

4) The optimum values for each variable are obtained.  

As seen in Figure 18, it is common to perform screening process with first-
order to reduce the cost and time. After several iterations towards the 
desired output, a second-order model is used to determine the final 
results. The optimization by means of RSM is carried out step by step.  For 
each step, only part of the valid value range is considered.  The center of 
this range is the current center point. Half the width of the range 𝑤 is a 
relative size and refers to the size of the value range of the respective 
factor.  For better manageability, the factor values are converted from 
their natural value ranges into coded value ranges without units. 

Range w1  
Figure 18: Structure of Response Surface Method (RSM) [184] 

To determine the optimum conditions for the control variables over a 
predefined region, a fitting model is required. For first degree models, the 
method of steepest ascent can be used, which is an extension of Laplace 
method to approximate an integral. Usually, the first-degree model is 
used for the RSM preliminary stage. For second-degree models, the 

46 

Range w2 



2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization 
 
 

method of ridge analysis can be used. It optimizes the response of interest 
subject to 𝑥 being on a hypersphere surface with the radius 𝑟. With the 
method of Lagrange multipliers, the optimum can be searched [180] [181] 
[182]. 

                                                  ∑𝑘 𝑥2𝑖=1 𝑖 = 𝑟2                                                 (22) 

The RSM approach provides a numerical approach to deal with 
discrepancies in the design space. Thereby, it can efficiently smooth out 
numerical noise. While most optimization methods only vary one factor 
at a time and keep the others constant, RSM can vary them 
simultaneously. Another advantage is the progressive change in 
experimental design until a fitting model is found. It can also help 
identifying an optimum value beyond the factor levels and therefore 
determine the future direction of research. Its major disadvantage is a 
mixing of higher order effects. Designs with only a few points may fit 
higher order surfaces but the higher order effects will be mixed with other 
effects resulting in the inability to distinguish the true effects. Another 
drawback is in the complex problems with long data series which are 
requiring more sample points. In such cases, the optimization process is 
costly because each new sample point requires a new calculation of the 
coefficients of the surrogate problem which entails a high computational 
burden and a huge memory consumption [180] [184]. 

2.3.4 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Approach 

Minitab® software is a statistic and analysis package developed by 
Pennsylvania University. With its modular structure, it enables the 
Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) to identify the significance of the model 
and to calculate the effects and interactions of the process parameters on 
various dependent variables. For each of the effects and interactions, 
Minitab calculates an F-value (ratio of variance) and a P-value 
(significance value). The logical analysis of these two factors indicates 
whether the results are random or not. Additionally, the mean value is 
calculated for the data as well as the standard deviation. Minitab uses the 
F-value to calculate the P-value, which you use to make a decision about 
the statistical significance of the terms and model. The F-value is the test 
statistic used to determine whether the term is associated with the 
response. A sufficiently large F-value indicates that the term or model is 
significant. 

47 



2   State-of-the-art Technologies, Concerns and Optimization Solutions 
 

The significance value, which is often called P-value, describes the 
probability of an observed data situation under the null hypothesis. The 
null hypothesis is the assumption that a certain effect does not exist in the 
data. If the P-value is small enough, it can be assumed that the effect 
exists. The smaller the P-value is, the stronger the significance. If the 
P-value is below 0.05%, it is statistically significant. Often the P-value is 
marked with stars to illustrate the strength of significance of the data 
situation. When the P-value is between 0.05 and 0.01, the effect is marked 
with *. When it is between 0.01 and 0.001, the effect is marked with ** and 
if it is below 0.001 it is marked with *** [185] [186].

3 Description of the Applied Methodology 
and the Utilized Machines and Materials 

This chapter is going to illustrate the material and the applied 
methodology in this study. In order to collect the data corresponding to 
criteria defined in the trade-off model, conduction of a set of experiments 
is required. There are management tools utilized in business 
organizations to prepare for the experiments. Cause and effect diagram, 
Ishikawa or Fishbone diagram is one of such management tool to 
elaborate influencing factors on a certain process. Thereby, in Ishikawa 
diagram, the causes are divided in 5 to 6 root-cause categories, which all 
start with ‘M’. As explained for the objectives definition in chapter 1.1, the 
quality criterion optimization is considered as the preliminary aim of this 
study due to the fact that the inherence of novelty of the studied oven 
technology is addressing the quality improvement for soldering process in 
SMT industry. Figure 19 shows that the quality root-causes for soldering 
process are the method, machinery, mother nature (environment), 
manpower and material. Herewith all causes are kept constant as to avoid 
unwanted distortions, and defects caused by printing and placement 
machine. Because the main focus lies on soldering process and hence 
further influences by other processes in the production chain should be 
kept minimum as possible.

3   Description of the Applied Methodology and the Utilized Machines and Materials 
 

The Ishikawa diagram for soldering process is obtaining a big picture to 
structure the breakdown of root-causes for a void-free solder joint. Each 
root cause is therefore elaborated in detail. For the methodology, a road 
map is presented which is formulating the connection of objectives, the 
trade-off model and the methods which are used to target a 
multi-objective process optimization. Furtherly, the materials and 
machines regarded for the experimental study are presented. These are 
comprised of the oven technology, the experimental demonstrator, the 
measurement instruments and the quality inspection devices. The 
Manpower and Mother Nature is assumed to be constant factors.  

3.1 Methodology for the Multi-objective Process 
Optimization 

The production of electronic products is intensively trending to decrease 
the production cost while the product quality is increasing. Additionally, 
the products become more and more technical and miniaturized, and the 
offered solutions to manufacture them are becoming more complex. In 
the recent years, application of intelligence-based methods by means of 
process analysis, control and optimization is not evitable. Especially 
computational intelligence and its applications have been used, as they 
are able to learn from the data and experience, to self-organize, to adapt 
in response to dynamically changing conditions and to solve real world 
problems. This study is utilizing the statistical and mathematical methods 
to analyze the data, building up the models to control the process, and 
configuring the intelligence-based algorithm for further usages as 
prediction, diagnose, and optimization tool. These methods however are 
used previously in various case studies in electronics production, but in 
this study, all are configured as a set of solution in the trade-off model.  

The proposed roadmap for a multi-objective optimization problem is 
illustrated using a case study for an overpressure soldering technology. 
Furthermore, this work is defining a mechanism for the void-free 
overpressure soldering process. Figure 20 shows the flowchart roadmap of 
the optimization process. A set of experimental data was collected from 
the oven technology. To obtain the most influencing variables on voiding 
process, a screening study is conducted before the full factorial Design of 
Experiment (DOE), and the meta-models are illustrating the measure of 
influences. The same approach is conducted for energy, time and cost 
criteria in the trade-off model. For the energy factor, exergy is utilized to 
evaluate the thermodynamic interaction of various resources used in the 

50

process. First, the power consumption is measured, and the consumed 
auxiliary resources are defined. Furtherly, the power consumption of 
periphery instruments for the oven are modelled and simulated. The time 
factor should be minimized, and the cost factor comprise of several 
parameters that have to be calculated individually.

The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used for the data analytics and to 
find the effects and interactions of the process parameters. The Response 
Surface Methodology (RSM) is employed to acquire the optimal heating 
parameters, while the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) − 
Backpropagation Network (BPN) algorithm is utilized to formulate 
nonlinear cause-and-effect relationships of the process factors and 
responses by learning from the experimental dataset. These algorithms 
are used as the means of optimization and diagnose tool for the multi-
objective process. In parallel, both the RSM and ANN methods are 
compared for their prediction accuracy as if to investigate the best applied 
method in this case study. Including the multi-objective process, a 
ranking approach and decision making method is developed which is 
offering a compromised solution based vectors for the trade-off model. 

3.2 Utilized Machines and Soldering Oven Integrated 
With an Overpressure Module 

To conduct the experimental work, a surface mounted demonstrator 
board is assembled utilizing the solder printing machine, electronic 
component placement machine (mounter), and soldering oven 
technology. The SMT assembly process is already shown in Figure 1. The 
solder paste was applied by a stencil printer of type Horizon 03iX (ASM 
Assembly Systems GmbH & Co. KG, Munich) on substrate. The machine 
is able to apply a pressure from 0 to 20 kg at a printing pace from 2 to 300 
mm per second. In this study, the stencil printing was done with 
aluminum blade squeegee with 45° angle, stencil thickness of 110 μm, 
print force of 4.0 kg and 35 mm/sec print velocity. In the next step, the 
electronic components were placed by a SIPLACE SX2 (ASM Assembly 
Systems GmbH & Co. KG, Munich) placement machine. It has a 
theoretical placement rate of 67,750 components per hour at a placement 
accuracy of ± 22 μm, ± 0.05°/(3sec). In the third step, the substrate-
mounted components will be sent to the soldering oven. Figure 21 shows 
the reflow oven used in this study, which is manufactured by Seho 
Systems GmbH (SEHO Systems GmbH, Kreuzwertheim). This oven is 
equipped with an overpressure chamber module in the peak zone with a 
total volume of 240 liter, and it is designed to build the overpressure up to 
maximum standard of 4.2 bar using compressed air or nitrogen. For the 
proper transport of PCBs during the soldering process in the oven a metal 
carrier frame is used which is ensuring a safe delivery of substrate from 
the preheating zone to overpressure module and along the entire process.

Figure 21: MaxiReflow 3.0 HP integrated with overpressure module [188] 

The main function of MaxiReflow 3.0 HP is to ensure a void-free soldering 
process using the integrated technology module. The main focus of this 
work is elaborating a multi-objective optimization solution utilizing the 
Seho soldering oven, and therefore a comprehensible explanation on the 
detail functional configuration of this technology is presented in 
chapter 4. 

3.3 Material, Measurement Tools and Instruments 

The surface mounted PCBs are processed according to the solder profiles 
for the experimental study. Each profile is designed with a specific oven 
machine setup, hence the power monitor instrument is utilized to 
measure, and therefore to study the influence of setup configuration 
changes on the power consumption. By means of investigating the heat 
transfer efficiency, online temperature of components material and the 
input data for resource consumption and efficiency analysis, a thermal 
profiler, KIC Profiler X5, is utilized to collect the online temperature of 
thermal points on one PCB per each profile. The utilized instruments and 
the demonstrator are presented in Figure 22. 

53 



3   Description of the Applied Methodology and the Utilized Machines and Materials 
 

 
Figure 22: Material and measurement instruments 

Surface mounted demonstrator: The surface mounted PCB shown in 
Figure 22 is one out of four PCBs in a multi-block panel. In order to 
increase the throughput of PCB assembly in SMT lines, PCBs are often 
designed in panels so that they consist of many smaller individual PCBs. 
The size of the panel is 370mm long and 200mm wide and all four PCBs 
are assembled with same electronic components with the same layout. 
The thickness of PCB is 1.5 mm, and the copper thickness of 35 µ. Each 
PCB is mounted with one Quad-Flat No-Leads (QFN), one accelerometer, 
four Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) and four resistors. For the means of 
void investigation, only the QFN solder joint is studied and the analysis is 
elaborated in chapter 4.2.1.  

The compounding material portion of the electronic components are 
investigated from the suppliers of the components and the summary is 
presented in Table 12.The PCB substrate contains the largest proportion 
with 45.77 gram of Fr4. The second largest proportion is the copper layer 
with 5.17 g of copper. A lead-free solder paste type of series F640 (Heareus 
GmbH, Hanau) is utilized with melting point of 217 °C, chemical 
compound of Sn96.5Ag3Cu0.5 and with particle size of 25 to 45 microns in 
a spherical shape. The solder paste contains 11% of flux, and the metal part 
is about 88 ± 1% with a viscosity of 130 ± 40 pascal-second. 

Power monitor: The collection of the current electrical energy 
consumption per each solder profile is followed by installation of power 
monitor instrument with 63 A connection between the oven machine and 
electrical energy source. The measurement device SENTRON PAC 4200 
from SIEMENS Company does the record of the measurement values. The 
device is following the performance accuracy class according to IEC 

54 



3.4   Quality Inspection Instruments and the Machine for Destructive and Non-destructive 
Tests 

 
 
61557-12 with a deviation of 0.2% from the measurement values. With the 
current configuration of the device, the measurement range is 2 A–200 A 
per phase, between 0 V–400 V [189]. The recording and presentation of 
the measured values are done through a LAN-interface with an external 
computer. The measurement device is continuously measuring the 
current values every 200 ms for active power, apparent power, and 
reactive power. It is important to notice the timestamp to record the right 
process duration. The series of data are transportable to an Excel page and 
hence it could be presented as a data series chart [190]. The current power 
consumption per measuring time point is calculated by multiplying the 
measuring time interval by the measured current value of the active 
power. The approach for electrical energy consumption analysis is 
furtherly explained in the chapter 5.2.2. 

Thermal profiling measurement instrument: The temperature of heat 
source and the desired temperature value on the surface of substrate in 
the soldering process is always changing and the heat transfer coefficient 
is controlling the transfer ratio. Further factors such as the size of the 
electronic components also affecting on the consistency of heat transfer, 
and therefore it causes the variation of the temperature value on different 
spots on the surface of the substrate. Therefore, KIC Profiler X5 (KIC, San 
Diego, USA) is utilized to acquire the real-time temperature values in the 
soldering process and to control the thermal process. The device has 
seven measurement channels to measure and acquire the temperature 
values in the range of -150 °C and 1050 °C, and accuracy of ± 0.5 °C. The 
instrument is able to measure a temperature value every 0.1 seconds. To 
ensure the KIC Profiler functionality, it has to be isolated to maintain its 
working temperature between 0 °C and 85 °C. During the conduction of 
experiments, the thermocouples are attached to three points on PCBs. 
The first one on the PCB substrate, the second one on the solder joint 
material, and the third one is so attached to measure the reflow air 
temperature one centimeter above the surface of the substrate. The 
profiler is then connected to the PC software to read and to plot the time-
based temperature dataset during the soldering process. 

3.4 Quality Inspection Instruments and the Machine 
for Destructive and Non-destructive Tests 

A primary feature of solder joint quality is visually inspecting the occurred 
defects through non-destructive tests. Hence, a microscope is utilized as 
the traditional visual inspection tool to inspect the optical failures. An 

55 



3   Description of the Applied Methodology and the Utilized Machines and Materials 
 

X-ray machine form Nordson Dage is utilized for an inter-core inspection 
of solder joints and therefore the size of voids. The shear tester from 
XYZTEC is used to conduct the destructive tests to investigate the 
strength of sheer force of the solder joints. The shear test by itself is not 
evaluating the defects but the connection between the size and position 
of voids in the solder joint may affect the reliability of the solder joint 
during the use phase of the product life cycle. Therefore, this test is also 
conducted to investigate the correlation with voids fraction. The utilized 
instruments and machines for quality inspections are shown in Figure 23. 

 
Figure 23: Quality inspection instruments and machines 

Microscope instrument: Many of the possible solder joint defects are 
investigable through optical inspection of the surface of the solder joints. 
Therefore, a stereomicroscope type SMZ 1500 (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, 
Japan) is used. The microscope has a resolution of 3840 x 3072 pixels, a 
zoom ratio of 15 to 1 and a zoom range from 0.75x to 11.25x. The PC 
software connected to the instrument enables the image processing. The 
microscope is mainly used for the general investigation of solder defects 
and the investigations are furtherly explained in chapter 4.2.6. 

X-ray machine: The XD7600NT Diamond FP (Nordson Corporation, 
Westlake, USA) X-ray machine is utilized to capture the images in order 
to investigate the measure of voids fraction in solder joints. The 
XD7600NT scanner is a 2D radiography inspection device with a DAGE 
NT100 sealed-transmissive 160kV X-ray tube and a DAGE 3 CMOS flat 
panel detector. The inspection device was fitted with the DAGE μCT 
inspection option which provides CT functionality by adding a rotation 
stage and a CT reconstruction workstation. The machine has a resolution 
of 1940 x 1530 pixels, a geometric magnification of 2500x, a system 
magnification of 7100x and a digital zoom magnification of 35000x. The 

56 



3.4   Quality Inspection Instruments and the Machine for Destructive and Non-destructive 
Tests 

 
 
μCT option allows easy installation and removal of the rotation stage and 
thus provides fast switching between 2D and 3D inspection tasks. The 
void fraction analysis approach is furtherly explained in chapter 4.2.1.    

Shear test instrument: Shear testing is performed to determine the 
shear strength of a material. It measures the maximum shear stress that 
may be sustained before a material will rupture. The strength of the solder 
joints in the context of this work are measured with the help of the shear 
tester XYZTEC Condor 150-3 (XYZTEC, Panningen, Netherlands). The 
instrument is doing the pull and shear tests with the measurement 
accuracy of 0.1% for the substrates with the maximum size of 140 mm x 
100 mm. The axis is motioning up to 5 mm/sec with the accuracy of 
0.5μm, and it is able to conduct the shear testing in the range of 8N and 
400N. This instrument is used to investigate the shear strength of four 
resistors in each PCB, and the analyses are furtherly explained in 
chapter 4.2.5

4 Quality Investigation for Overpressure 
Soldering Process through Design of 
Experiments (DOE) 

This chapter is aiming to build a full factorial DOE by means of preparing 
the dataset for this study, and the focus initially lies on quality factor for 
soldering process. First, the soldering technology is introduced, and the 
soldering process is explained in detail to identify the most influencing 
variables on quality and a void-free solder joint. These variables are sorted 
out by a screening study before the full factorial DOE for the sake of cost 
and time effectiveness. Further, the set of parameters defined in the DOE 
is utilized to conduct the study for other criteria in the trade-off model 
including time, cost, and energy. 

4.1 Mapping of Process Variables and Responses for 
Solder Profiling With Overpressure Module 

An inherent part of conducting a design of experiment is to identify the 
process variables which are producing the response factors. There is a 
relation between the setup configuration of oven, heat transfer coefficient, 
and the temperature measures on the PCB components. To understand 
the thermal profiling, the process variables and setup configuration of the 
oven are studied. Combination of these variables is obtaining the profile 
and therefore the thermal gradient which is treating the PCB components. 

4.1.1 Description of the Soldering Machine 

In order to understand the mechanism of temperature profiling combined 
with the overpressure function, first a detailed explanation on the 
technical configuration of the soldering oven is presented. Subsequently 
by realizing the machine configuration, the technology constraints to 
setup the soldering process are elaborated. Hence, it derives a framework 
by which the design of experiment of this work is constructed. 

Figure 24, a) shows the schematic construction of reflow oven technology 
with overpressure module. The preheating stage uses convection to 
transfer the heat. The preheating stage is divided into six independently 
adjustable heating zones. Separate heating of the top or bottom of the 
mounted PCB product is possible. The top side of the sixth zone is

designed so that a selective infrared soldering process is optionally 
applicable. In the overpressure chamber, convection flow principle is used 
to transfer heat to the printed circuit assembly, and quartz (infrared) 
heater is used to apply additional heat to the unit. The combination of 
convection and quartz heating during overpressure process ensures stable 
and reproducible temperature conditions. The overpressure chamber is 
equipped with two heating zones.

As shown in Figure 24, b), after a short time at peak temperature and 
natural outgassing of evaporated volatiles , Nitrogen gas (N2) is pumped 
from an external intermediate cylinder into the chamber, and pressure is 
built-up to hold and suppress the solder joint against formation of new 
voids in the solder joint. By instantly releasing the pressure, the recent 
formed voids are outgassed. To freeze the void-free solder joint, the 
pressure is built up again and held until the joint is slowly cooled. This is 
done by the clocked conveyor travers system, which transports the 
product to the second convection zone of the hyper pneumatic chamber. 
At the second position, the joint is simultaneously completely cooled and 
the pressure is completely released. The nominal temperature in the 
second zone is already set to a value below the liquidus temperature of 
solder alloy, which allows the solder to solidify while under pressure. This 
squeeze-release process mechanism forces voids to gas out of the solder 
connections. Then, the PCB is delivered to the cooling zone, where two 
individual cooling stages use running water and air as a coolant [188] [191].  

4.1.2 Description of the Solder Profiling 

The reflow soldering process is thermally treating the substrate assembled 
with electronic components in a specific temperature level, for a specified 
period of time, at a proper heating gradient. A thermal profile time-
temperature curve is commonly generated to adjust the heating 
parameters and to control the thermal effects on the assembled boards. 
As illustrated in Figure 24, b), the timestamps of reflow thermal profile 
separated into 4 process zones in which the heat for each zone is 
independently controllable. These are preheating, soaking, reflow (peak) 
and cooling zones. Each heating zone is controlled with a heating 
gradient rate and elapse time, and the function mechanism of each zone 
is explained in detail in the following.  

Preheating zone 

Generally the solder material is heated to its liquidus temperature. The 
preheating time not only defines the time that takes during the 
preheating zone, but also defines the time between the initial 
temperature and the melting temperature. It is crucial not to exceed the 
maximum permissible load temperature and the processing time. If the 
process is too slow in the preheating zone, there is a risk that the flux will 
be consumed completely, and if it is too fast, the flux activation is not 
taking place. Furtherly the blowing fan power is regulating the efficiency 
of convectional heat transfer from the zones onto the substrates.

(DOE) 

 

Therefore, a well-defined heating gradient in preheating zone is assuring a 
qualitative soldering process. The heating gradient of 0.5 °C/sec–1 °C/sec 
is recommended in the preheating zone [12], and it can be calculated by 
equation 23. The initial temperature is 25 °C which is the ambient 
temperature. 210 °C is selected as the outlet temperature before the PCB 
enters into the overpressure chamber. The length of preheating zone is 
2400 mm, and hence according to the recommended gradient in the 
literature, the transport band speed is calculated between 39 cm/min–78 
cm/min.

The purpose of preheating is to allow the solvents to evaporate and to 
activate the flux. An increment part of preheating zone is soaking zone. 
The soak zone brings the temperature of all components and board areas 
to an equal level. Due to differences in thermal inertia and thermal 
capacity of materials, components do not heat up at the same speed. This 
is especially the reason of infrared heating before the peak zone. However, 
uneven absorption of infrared energy is deduced due to color and surface 
reflectivity of components in demonstrators with thru-hole components. 
As shown in Figure 25, in the preheating zone, the PCB material and 
solder joint temperature curves are showing a temperature-increase up to 
150 °C. Subsequently in the soaking zone, the temperatures of these 
components are demonstrating a close and similar behavior as the air 
temperature in the oven. It is inferred that the materials that are 
absorbing the heat reference with delay, then losing it slower. 

Peak zone 

In the reflow zone, the temperature rises at a rate of approximately 
2 °C/sec to a temperature above the melting point (the temperature above 
liquidus).The desired fast soldering process requires a minimum soldering 
temperature of 10% above melting point (based on Kelvin scale), 
independent from the solder alloy. This is because solder both joins better 
with the copper and wets the pads and component pins better when it is 
hotter, and thereby it is creating better solder joint. On the other hand, 
high temperatures are usually prohibited for assembly processes because 
of sensitive components and printed circuit board materials. The 
temperature above liquidus should be held for 40 to 80 seconds, so that 
an intermetallic compound is able to form [33].  

62 



4.1   Mapping of Process Variables and Responses for Solder Profiling With Overpressure 
Module 

 
 
In addition of considerations for the peak zone in classical soldering 
ovens, the pressure build up process in the oven in this study is 
influencing the thermal behavior of materials in the peak zone. Additional 
mechanical function of pressure build-up is affecting the elongation of 
reflow time and the process details are illustrated in Figure 25. The setup 
peak temperature for this profile is 285 °C. When the PCB is entering into 
the overpressure chamber, the solder material will be in molten state. 
However, as like the function of soaking zone in preheating zone, the 
material of different electronic components are requiring an elapsing time 
to reach to peak temperature. The solder material is requiring a waiting 
time at normal pressure to ensure complete natural outgassing of the 
gasses formed. Then, the PCB is subject to overpressure, which is 
decelerating the new gas formations in the solder joint. In the next step, 
the pressure is released, and the existing voids or the trapped gases are 
exhausted out of the solder joint during the pressure release leading to 
reduce voids. The overpressure and release process can be repeated up to 
two times to ensure the completion of gas exhaust from the solder joint 
(multiple Squeeze-Release) and it follows with the final pressure built-up 
(Squeeze).  

As illustrated in Figure 25, the PCB is moved into the second zone in 
overpressure chamber for solidification, which is setup with a 
temperature below the liquidus temperature of solder material (Freeze). 
An important step here is that before releasing the final pressure, the 
components are to be moved into the second position to ensure a 
void-free solder connection. During this process, there are six quartz-
based heaters in the bottom side of the chamber which is homogenizing 
the heat treatment and therefore the incident temperature differences 
due to the overpressure build-ups. The pressure build-up cause a sudden 
temperature drop, and subsequently the quartz heaters immediately are 
compensating the heat drop by an incident increase of heat source under 
the substrate, which is demonstrated as peaks in the air temperature 
curve in Figure 25. In contrary by the overpressure release, the air 
temperature is also showing an incident drop in the curve which is 
compensated immediately by the quartz heaters. 

Cooling zone 

The time between the solidification point of the solder and the reaching 
of the final temperature is defined in the literature as the cooling time, 
which should be kept as short as possible [12]. In the cooling zone, two 
situations could occur. During rapid cooling, a fine-grained structure can 

63 



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments 
(DOE) 

 

form which is positively influencing on the stability of the solder joint. On 
the other hand, a fast rapid cooling cause the stress and damage of 
components due to the different expansion coefficients [18] [192]. In the 
literature, the value for the cooling time for electronics production has 
been recommended between 40 and 60 seconds [179]. The cooling zone is 
equipped with cooling water pipes. Two convectional blowing fans are 
continuously exchanging the heat source in this zone with the 
environment. The substrates are nearly reaching to the ambient 
temperature when they are leaving the reflow oven.  

4.1.3 Process Variables and Responses 

Previous studies for reflow soldering process in SMT assembly are 
confirming that there should be an agreement between the design of the 
assembly, settings of the reflow oven, and the heating requirements for 
obtaining an acceptable reflow thermal profile [22] [24]. For the sake of 
efficiency, accuracy, and economical reasons, domain experts evaluated 
the collection of variables and chose ones that would be fruitful to an 
experimental design. Therefore, the process setup variables selection of 
the soldering process is based on the recommendations from literature 
review of this work, the screening process, and the field knowledge of 
veteran experts.  

The process setup variables are producing the heating requirements, and 
thermal profiling is controlling the quality of voiding process. The heating 
requirement for solder profiling in preheating zone associated with 
overpressure function are shown in Figure 24, b). Figure 25 is detailing the 
process variables in overpressure module. These variables specifically are 
associating a big influence on voiding process mechanism in the first zone 
of overpressure module. By control of these variables, the responses could 
be controlled. The soldering oven technology with overpressure function 
is proven for the minimization of void fraction, but the setup function 
(combination of the setup variables of the machine technology) and the 
mechanism of the overpressure module is not scientifically investigated 
yet.

Figure 26 is showing the input setup variable and heating requirement

(peak zone), and cooling zone, as well as PCB flow pitch. The conveyor 
speed and temperature (°C) setup are defining the responses including 
the slope (°C/sec) and the measure of heating or cooling rates. The setup 
parameters in overpressure chamber, as seen in Figure 25, is the 
combination of the gas pressure build-up, the measure of the pressure 
and the in-between process waiting times. These parameters are crucial 
because they are defining the thermal treatment for a void-free soldering 
process under the overpressure and above the liquidus temperature. 
Given the same temperature settings, the PCB flow gap also should be 
defined so that the pace of process flow in the oven kept constant. The 
throughput time in the overpressure chamber is always lower than the 
preceding process flow in the preheating zone. Hence, the PCB gap 
between two consecutive boards (the input PCB into the oven) should be 
so designed that it obtains a continuous flow process in the entire oven. 
Furthermore, the air fans power are setup for the maximum configurable 
measure because it obtains the maximum heat transfer coefficient on 
substrate.

4.2 Design of Experiment (DOE) and Quality 
Assessment Approach 

To conduct the RSM approach, first a Design of Experiment (DOE) design 
should be implemented. The DOE is the design of a framework that aims 
to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that 
are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The variation of information are 
usually rather complex and hence difficult to control. To cope with these 
difficulties and overcome the complexities, the variables should be 
discovered which have the most influence on response and therefore the 
cost of the experimental design also will be reduced. All process variables 
are introduced in Figure 26. 

As explained in chapter 2.3.3, for the first step, a set of 2k experiments 
should be conducted which are usually referred to as screening designs. 
The 2k refers to designs with 𝑘 factors where each factor has just two 
levels. These designs are created to explore a large number of factors, with 
each factor having the minimal number of levels, just two. By screening 
we are referring to the process of screening a large number of factors 
related to study. Due to efficiency, cost factor and accuracy, the collection 
of all variables could not be included in the design of experiment and 
those ones should be chosen that are fruitful with the most interactive 
effect on responses. More important factors are sorted out and used for 
the second-order models. After the screening the variables, the full 
factorial 3k design is used to analyze them to understand the actual 
response functions. The results are statistically analyzed and the 
interaction effect of variables on void creation is studied by application of 
RSM approach. Apart from void ratio investigation, the average of shear 
force for resistor components is investigated and the general optical 
inspection is conducted for further solder joint defects. In parallel, the 
power consumption of the oven technology during each experiment is 
measured and the results are used for resource consumption analysis.  

4.2.1 Void Ratio Investigation for Solder Joints 

To investigate the void fraction of solder joints, an image analysis 
approach is employed. The solder joint connection of a Quad-Flat No-
Leads (QFN), as shown in Figure 27, is considered for void formation 
investigation per each solder profile, because in the larger area of a solder 
joint larger inclusions of void can form. The X-ray images are captured 
with X-ray system, XD7600NT from Nordsen Dage (Figure 27, a)) and 
then they are analyzed for the void ratio analysis using the software 

67 



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments 
(DOE) 

 

ImageJ (Figure 27, b)). The software ImageJ is used as the means of color 
recognition tool, in which the voids appear with bright gray color from X-
ray images. The software ImageJ determines the threshold of the brighter 
and darker pixels, and it is coloring the darker area in red (Figure 27, b)). 
Using the tracing tool of the software, the pad area of the QFN that is 
soldered is being captured and it is shown in yellow border. This 
procedure is necessary because the image analysis requires the largest 
possible area, which has a uniform brightness level. By realizing the 
portion of the area with red pixels in yellow border, the void fraction is 
obtained by the software. The setup Macro for all images are kept 
constant and all reported fraction by the software are controlled again for 
the sake of the result accuracy.

analysis using ImageJ software 

4.2.2 Screening Process for the Most Influential Variables on 
Void Formation 

The screening process for the most influential variables is divided into 
three analysis steps in three individual zones for preheating, overpressure 
chamber and cooling zones. In each step, the void portion as the main 
objective of quality factor is investigated and analyzed for variables 
interaction. The starting point is proposition of a temperature setup 
created based on the thermal profiling constraints for process variables 
and responses as discussed in chapter 4.1.3.  

Because the Time Above Liquidus (TAL) is proven to be the most essential 
factor on void formation [10], the first attempt refers to the influential 
variables on void fraction in the first and second zone in the overpressure 
chamber. The applied solder material has a melting point of 217 °C. The 
recommended peak temperature in classical soldering process is 10% 

68 



4.2   Design of Experiment (DOE) and Quality Assessment Approach 
 
 

above the melting point of solder material. Due to additional overpressure 
function and unknown behavior of heating gradient of nitrogen gas 
during the overpressure process, the peak temperature in this study is 
setup 30% above the melting point and therefore 285 °C. The temperature 
in the second zone of overpressure chamber is set below the melting point 
of solder material and therefore 212 °C. The transport band speed is 60 
cm/min and the current setup power for the blowing fans is 70%. Waiting 
time between the pressure build-ups is kept minimum as possible so that 
the solder joint have less outgassing chance for further void formation. 
The second overpressure holding time should be long enough so that the 
PCB is moved to the second zone of chamber and subsequently cooled 
down below the liquids temperature. The speed of transport traverse band 
in the chamber is not crucial, and it should be configured at the highest 
speed. Lastly, the solder joint for an assured duration of waiting time in 
the second zone of chamber is cooled down after the second overpressure. 
Table 3 is showing the first setup attempt in screen process.

Based on the results with the lowest void portion in the screening process 
for overpressure chamber, these parameters are adopted for the 
subsequent experimental design in the preheating zone and the second 
zone in the chamber. The complete combination of the setup parameters 
fully determines the interactions between the parameters within a zone. 
However, at the current state of the study, it is not possible to make any 
statements about the interactions of the setup parameters across zones.  

In the profile setup in Table 3, there are 3 factors that are considered for 
changes in two levels, and therefore 8 (=23) experiments are conducted. 

69 



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments 
(DOE) 

 

The profile with the waiting time of 20 seconds before the first pressure 
build-up, 4 bar overpressure, and 5 seconds of pressure holding time is 
showing the best void fraction of 4.89%. In average for the examined 
DOE, the profiles with 20 seconds of waiting time, 4 bar overpressure are 
showing 50%, and profiles with 5 seconds of pressure holding time 25% 
less void fraction in compare with other profiles. The biggest void fraction 
among all profile is 15.60%.  

For the investigation of preheating zone, the preheating slope, soaking 
temperature and soaking time are targeted. In addition of thermal profile 
alteration, the conveyor speed is changed to study the thermal gradient of 
profiles. Table 4 is showing the profile setup for preheating zone.

The measures for the best results in the first zone of overpressure 
chamber are presumed and the transport band speed, temperature, and 
the power of blowing fans are changed in two levels. In addition of the 
attempted thermal profile (T1), the second profile (T2) is proposed. A  
good  and  fast  wetting  is  helpful  for  minimizing  the  amount  of  
voids. A  fast  wetting  which  is  able  to  transport  the developing  gases  
and  residues  out  of  the  solder  joints  needs  a  certain  minimum  
soldering  temperature.  

Karaalioglu [193] reported that for an efficient heat transfer rate for Seho 
oven, the peak temperature should be at least 10% above melting point, 

70 



4.2   Design of Experiment (DOE) and Quality Assessment Approach 
 
 

and therefore 250 °C is determined as the minimum peak temperature 
setup. For both profiles, the temperature is reaching from 25 °C to 210 °C 
before the peak zone. If the transport band is configured for 60 cm/min, 
the preheating gradient including the soaking zone is 0.76 °C/sec, and the 
maximum theoretical preheating gradient is 1.15 °C/sec if the band speed 
is setup for 90 cm/min. The PCB flow gap is neglected for further 
discussion at the current stage of the study; however, its importance will 
be illustrated when the overpressure chamber is defining the production 
pace of preceding process in the preheating zone.  

An experimental design with three variables including 8 (= 23) 
experiments is conducted. By the change of blowing fan power, however 
the heating rate is changing [26], but the result for void fraction in these 
profiles are not demonstrating a significant difference. The average 
difference of void portion for profiles with 70% fan power (5.62%) and 
100% fan power (5.78%) is only about 0.16%. The combination of T1 

thermal profile and 60 cm/min obtains preheating slope of 1.56 °C/sec and 
it follows with 160 seconds of soaking time. If the speed is increased up to 
90 cm/min, a steeper preheating slope of 2.3 °C/sec and 107 seconds of 
soaking time is obtained. The T2 profile and 60 cm/min combination is 
deriving a preheating slope of 1.25 °C/sec and 140 seconds of soaking time. 
If the speed of transport band is increased up to 90 cm/min, the 
preheating slope is increasing to 1.88 °C/sec and the soaking time is 
shortened to 93 seconds. This profile is obtaining the best result with 
3.87% void fraction.  

Comparing with other profiles, a fast preheating slope before the soaking 
zone, allow activating the flux, and the shortest soaking time illustrate 
adequate duration to forbid extra release of volatiles. In contrary, the 
combined T  

1 thermal profile with 90 cm/min demonstrates the worst 
result (7.70% void fraction). This is because the flux is activated much 
sooner and the solvents in higher temperature have faster gaseous 
activity. The analysis are explaining the void fraction reduction by a fast 
preheating slope before soaking zone and shortened soaking time. In 
addition, a smoother thermal process start aids the uniform treatment of 
PCB components material due to thermal inertia.  

In the final step of screening process, the setup factors within the second 
zone of chamber are investigated. In this zone, the solder material is 
cooled down under overpressure below the liquidus temperature, before 
it is completely cooled down in the cooling zone. From the recent results, 
the profile setup for T2 thermal profile with 100% blowing fan power and 

71 



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments

90 cm/min transport band speed is considered. If the first zone is setup 
for 250 °C, the minimum temperature in the second zone due to 
temperature balance of adjacent zones will be 203 °C. Also an alternative 
temperature of 212 °C which is very close to liquidus temperature is 
examined in the second zone. As mentioned before, solder material in the 
second zone is cooled below the liquids temperature and there should be 
enough time so that the solder joint, during overpressure, is moved from 
the first to the second zone. Once the overpressure is released, a fast 
cooling is required and hence two alternative measures are examined for 
the waiting time after the second pressure release. Table 5 is showing the 
setup profile for screening process in the second zone.

For the current experiments, three variables are changed and therefore 
eight experiments are conducted. The impact of current variables on the 
result is much higher than previous experiments. The profiles with 
temperature of 203 °C are demonstrating significantly lower average void 
fraction (13.38%) compare with the temperature level of 212 °C (18.88%). 
Longer overpressure holding time for 45 seconds obtains better result 
with an average void fraction of 12.88%. 30 seconds of overpressure 
holding time shows the average void fraction of 19.38%. The waiting time 
after the second pressure build-up for 20 seconds delivers 14.51% of void 
portion comparing with 35 seconds that obtains 17.74%. Therefore, the 
profile setup of 203 °C, 45 seconds of holding time and 20 seconds of 
waiting time is showing the best void portion of 4.56%. The worst result is 
demonstrated by setup of 212 °C, 30 seconds of holding time and 35

fraction of 22.43%.  

4.2.3 Development and Conduction of full factorial Design of 
Experiment (DOE) 

From the screening process in previous chapter, the independent 
variables that have vital effect on the soldering process are identified 
through a 2k design. For a comprehensive conduction of DOE, considering 
all variables, which are interacting on responses, are mandatory. However, 
there is a consideration of trade-off between data collection cost and 
sample size. To minimize the design deflection, Franklin [194] has 
provided an introduction to generate a 3K orthogonal array with 𝑘 design 
parameter. Orthogonal array testing is a systematic and statistical way of 
a black box testing technique used when number of inputs to the 
application under test is small but too complex for an exhaustive testing 
of every possible input to the system. 3K design will be used to find the 
optimal solution from the major factors which are identified in screening 
process.  

The screening process excluded the reflow zone, and it will be considered 
in Full Factorial design shown in Table 6. Some variables are realized with 
negligible influence and therefore they are set at their minimum value. 
Some variables are identified with their optimum value and hence they 
are set as constant in the DOE.  90 cm/min combined with T2 thermal 
profile derives a good preheating gradient and soaking time. The power of 
blower fans is set at its maximum. The first pressure build-up suppresses 
further creation of voids in the peak zone, and the release of pressure 
hence releases the voids created before the pressure build-up. The holding 
time and the waiting time after the first overpressure, is kept as 
minimum. 45 seconds is long enough so that the transport band in the 
chamber is moving the substrate from the first to the second zone, which 
is set below the liquidus temperature. The waiting time after the second 
overpressure is set according to the best result in screening process. 
Therefore, a set of configuration is tabulated below for a Full Factorial 
design of 27 run.

The heat absorption rate varies from component to component. The heat 
rate for a larger component (such as a quad flat package QFP component 
or substrate material) is slower than those for a smaller sized one (i.e., 
resistor chips/capacitor chips or solder joint). As seen in Figure 25, the 
components temperatures after entering into the first zone in the 
chamber are not uniform and they are depending on the temperature 
value and the waiting time before the first overpressure. Especially for the 
solder material and the heat absorption duration that has a big influence 
on the void formation in parallel with the overpressure function.

Therefore, additional measure of reflow temperature of 300 °C is 
considered in the full factorial DOE. Furthermore, according to the 
screening process, the waiting time until the first overpressure (the time 
above the liquidus) and the measure of overpressure level are 
demonstrated with significant interaction on void ratio creation. These 
three variables are considered for the DOE, and the setup profile is shown 
in Table 6. According to orthogonal array testing If we have 3 parameters, 
each can have 3 value level then the possible number of tests using 
conventional full factorial method is 27 (=33). The experiments are 
conducted and the results are discussed in the following session. 

4.2.4 Void Ratio Result, Statistical Analysis and Meta-model 
Development  

The optical inspection for all electronic components is conducted and 
four QFN packages per each profile are investigated for void fraction. The 
utilized solder material 𝑆𝑛96.5𝐴𝑔3𝐶𝑢0.5 exhibits a non-eutectic behavior. 
Soldering process will be complicated if the solder alloy does not behave 
as a eutectic4 and solidifies over a range of temperature with more than 
one stage of solidification. The solder joint might be formed at the lowest 
possible temperature of solidification for any mixture of specified 
constituents. Solidification begins at around 219 °C with the growth of 
primary tin (Sn) dendrites which continue to grow as the solder cools to 
217 °C when the remaining liquid, enriched in silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), 
solidifies as a eutectic [10]. The molten solder is isolated within the 
network of primary tin dendrites and therefore the solidification and 
reduction of the volume delivers accommodated voids. Voids created in 
this process are obtained irregular shape that reflects the shape of the 
solidification front that formed them. If the reduction of volume is 
extreme, the shrinkage of the voids could intersect the surface of the 
solder joint which appears as crack cavity or shrink hole. However, no 
crack is observed in the solder joints as defects. This is because the void 
size in the preceding process in the peak zone is reduced under 
overpressure before creation of macro voids.  

In interval plot shown in Figure 28, the void fractions are plotted and the 
average result per each solder profile are shown. Individual standard 
deviations were used to calculate the intervals. The ANOVA analysis is

 Relating to or denoting a mixture of substances (in fixed proportions) that melts and

constituents or of any other mixture of them.

performed with Minitab software, which is already introduced in chapter 
2.3.4. The regression analysis demonstrates R2 value of 81.40%. R-squared 
explains the variability of the response data around its mean. Hence, in 
this case, this value explains that the model 81.40% fits the void ratio data 
well. This ratio could be improved if the standard deviation would be less 
for the results of profile numbers such as 12, 22, 23, and 25. By the 
decrease of Individual standard deviations in each profile, R2 is increasing, 
however in a dynamic and qualitative process like void formation, this 
value is considered as a good fit value. Temperature profile 7 (250 °C, 4 
bar, 20 sec) with lowest standard deviation shows the lowest average void 
ratio of 4.54%, and temperature profile 3 (250 °C, 0 bar, 60 sec) 
demonstrate the largest void ratio of 28.34%.

After data collection, they should be checked for model adequacy using 
the residual plots. A high R2 value demonstrated with good results from 
residual plot is proving the reliability of the model. If the normality 
assumption is not violated, the conclusion reached by a regression 
analysis in which normality is assumed will generally be reliable and 
accurate. From the normal probability plot, to determine whether the 
void ratio data follow the distribution, the P-value is compared to the 
significance level. Usually, a significance level of 0.05 (5%) is reliable. If 
the P-value is larger than the significance level, the decision is to fail to 
reject the null hypothesis because there is not enough evidence to 

76

conclude that the data do not follow the distribution. Hence, a 
significance level of 0.05, indicates on the risk that the data do not follow 
the distribution is 5%. The probability plot assesses how closely the data 
points follow the fitted distribution line. If the specified theoretical 
distribution is a good fit, the data points fall closely along the straight 
line. As shown in Figure 29, the void ratio in the normal probability plot 
follows the fitted line well. In addition, the null hypothesis states that the 
data follow a normal distribution. Because the P-value is 0.192, which is 
greater than the significance level of 0.05, the decision is to fail to reject 
the null hypothesis. It cannot be conclude that the data do not follow a 
normal distribution. 

A residual versus fitted values plot is used to check if the variances of the 
error terms are constant and they must have a mean of zero. If this is not 
the case, your model may not be valid. To check these assumptions, as 
shown in Figure 29, the points on the plot appear to be randomly 
scattered around zero, so assuming that the error terms have a mean of 
zero is reasonable. The vertical width of the scatter does not appear to 
increase or decrease across the fitted values, so we can assume that the 
variance in the error terms is constant, and the model is reliable.

A histogram is most effective when there are approximately 20 or more 
data points. As for this study, the histogram for 27 profiles are not

showing a long tail in one direction, or a bar that is far away from the 
other bars, and hence the model does meet the model assumptions.   

The residuals versus order plot mean to verify the assumption that the 
residuals are independent from one another and to detect the time 
dependence of the residuals. The demonstrated plot shows the randomly 
distribution of residuals around the centerline, and also no trends or 
patterns when displayed in time order.  

After results verification, an analysis with Full Factorial design is 
conducted to investigate the significance level. The deployed design is a 
second-order model but the analysis are conducted for linear and 
interaction of factors on responses. Table 7 shows the effects (F-value) 
and significances (P-value) of the setup parameters on void ratio. Pressure 
parameter demonstrate that it has the highest statistically significance 
associated effect on the void ratio with F-value of 29.39, which is proved 
by P-value of 0.000. Temperature and waiting time parameters are also 
showing their significance by P-values of 0.007 and 0.028 in the next 
levels. The analyses of parameters interaction illustrate the highest 
significance of temperature and pressure effect on each other with F-value 
of 39.52. The pressure and waiting time interaction is showing the lowest 
effect because the waiting time occurs before the pressure build-up in the 
process.

By using the main effects plot, the differences between level means for 
one or more factors is examined. There is a main effect when different 
levels of a factor affect the response differently. A main effects plot graphs 
the response mean for each factor level connected by a line. As shown in 

78 



4.2   Design of Experiment (DOE) and Quality Assessment Approach 
 
 

Figure 30, the increase of pressure shows a significant difference in the 
magnitude of the effect on reduction of void ratio. The significance 
analysis also proves this fact. In addition, the increase of waiting time 
demonstrates the increase of void ratio formation. Although the increase 
of temperature shows the increase of void formation up to 285 °C but the 
further temperature raise up to 300 °C consumes the solder volatiles 
completely. 

Using an interaction plot, shown in Figure 31, infers that how the 
relationship between a parameter setup and void ratio depends on the 
value of the second parameter setup factor. This plot displays means for 
the levels of one factor on the X-axis and a separate line for each level of 
another factor. For some parameters, the lines are rather parallel and no 
interaction occur, however for the temperature and pressure parameters, 
the most nonparallel lines are illustrating the magnificent of strength of 
the interaction. The significance of interaction is illustrated in Table 7, 
and this fact is proven by the highest F-value. The pressure and waiting 
time combination are displayed with rather parallel line with a slight 
interaction. At the temperature of 250 °C, the increase of waiting time 
significantly effect on the increase of void ratio; however the waiting time 
has not much effect on void formation increase in other two temperature 
levels. Likewise, the pressure increase straightly decrease the void fraction 
at the temperature of 250 °C, however the effect of pressure changes in 
other two temperature levels are not much significant on void formation.

Figure 31: Interaction plot for void ratio 

The interaction effect diagrams for all profiles with the respective setup 
parameters are plotted by MATLAB software and they are shown in Figure 
32. The curve fitting tool is used to interpolate the data by Thin-plate 
spline method. From Figure 32, a), it is inferable that respect to the 
significant interaction of temperature and pressure, the void ratio by 
increase of pressure and decrease of temperature is highly decreasing. 
However, the associated technology limit for overpressure chamber (the 
maximum allowed overpressure setup up to 4 bar), and the limitation for 
the minimum heat transfer coefficient (the minimum setup temperature 
for the oven (250 °C) respect to solder material with melting temperature 
of 217 °C), does not enable further investigations beyond this setup 
measures to investigate more extended interaction of these factors.  

The pressure of inside void bubble gas is contributed directly by the 
evaporation of flux and associated solvent and it depends on the 
temperature. The pressure of atmosphere is prohibiting the void to grow, 
and on the other hand, if the temperature of flux is reaching to the 
equilibrium, it stops evaporating and hence the void stops growing. 
Therefore, the void ratio is less at the waiting time of 20 seconds 
comparing with 60 seconds. In addition, by increase of overpressure level 
in the machine, voids are stopping growing, and by the release of 
overpressure, the macro voids are tending to escape. A higher 

80 



4.2   Design of Experiment (DOE) and Quality Assessment Approach 
 
 

overpressure gives the voids a higher chance and longer time to release. 
As shown in Figure 32, a), if this fact is combined with lower temperature 
at 250 °C where the solvents have even less chance of creation of more 
gas, then it obtains the best results. The best void ratio is achieved at a 
peak temperature of 250 °C, waiting time of 20 seconds, and pressure of 4 
bar. The results for 300 °C at different levels of overpressure are rather 
similar because the flux volatiles are already consumed before the 
overpressure changes make a significant effect on voids release.

Figure 32: Surface plot for interaction effects on void ratio for: a) temperature and pressure 
b) temperature and waiting time c) waiting time and pressure 

Figure 32, b) demonstrate that by increase of the waiting time (reflow 
time and/or time above liquidus) and temperature (peak temperature), 
the void formation is progressing, because the micro-voids have more 
time to form the bigger voids as well as the flux evaporation is prolonged. 
If the bigger voids have enough reflow time to reach the surface, and/or if 
the temperature is increasing to certain state, bigger voids are able to 
escape and hence the incidence of voiding is reduced. The high incidence 
of voiding with the lower temperature is thought to be due to the inferior 

81 



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments 
(DOE) 

 

wetting that left a lot of non-wetted areas to which a bubble could attach 
and less time for the trapped bubble to escape from the molten solder 
during the time above liquidus.  In contrary, the higher incidence of 
voiding with the high reflow profile is thought to be due to the higher 
incidence of non-wetted areas because of the exhaustion of flux activity 
during the longer TAL. This is also inferred in Figure 30 for the 
temperature effect on void fraction changes. The largest void ratio is 
achieved at a peak temperature of 285 °C, waiting time of 60 seconds, and 
pressure of 0 bar. However, by increase of temperature up to 300 °C, the 
void ratio begins decreasing. The waiting time and pressure factors are 
associating the lowest interaction significance, and hence their influence 
on void ratio should be interpreted separated. In Figure 32, c), the void 
ratio is not considerably changing, however the pressure build-up assist 
the voids to be minimized. The pressure influence on void ratio appears 
almost linear. Higher pressure obtains lower void ratio. The interaction of 
the pressure with the waiting time shows a simple pattern.  

4.2.5 Shear Force Investigation of Solder Joints, Statistical 
Analysis and Results 

The shear force test is conducted based on 2k design to investigate the 
main effects of 3 main variables are defined in Table 6. Therefore, per 
each profile, 8 measures are required for this test. The average of shear 
force for two resistors per each single PCB is calculated, and hence four 
PCB in one panel obtains four average values. Figure 33 plotted the 4 
mean of measures and the total average per each profile. The best shear 
force is addressed by the profile 7 (250 °C, 4 bar, 20 sec) with the measure 
of 37.81 N, and the weakest at temperature profile 23 (300 °C, 2 bar, 40 
sec) with the measure of 26.69 N. The analysis of variance shows standard 
deviation of 2.46, and shear force average of 30.73 N. The R2 value of 
43.25% and R2 prediction value of 3.50% illustrate that the regression 
fitted model hardly explains the distribution of results around its mean. 
However, the low R2 prediction and big deviation from R2 value shows 
that the model is not reliable for further prediction usage, and it cannot 
be interpreted through three major variables. Therefore, the shear force 
data are not furtherly analyzed for their significance and variance. From 
the results it could be drawn that by increase of temperature the shear 
force is intensively decreasing, and by increase of waiting time, shear 
force rather increasing. In all profiles the shear force shows a linear 
increase from 2 to 4 bar.

4.2.6 Further Solder Joint Defects 

All demonstrators are optically inspected for any anomalies and defects 
listed in chapter 2.3.1. There are a constant number and size of solder balls 
are seen across the solder joints of resistors and none on the other 
electronic components. Too high heating gradient cause the creation of 
solder balls in soldering process, however, solder balls are detected in 
profiles with low heating gradients in this study. It is inferred that solder 
paste residues in stencil printing should be the main reason. The solder 
balls do not harm the electrical minimum isolation distance and therefore 
no short circuit detected. In all profiles, no further defects are detected. 

4.3 Conclusion 

In this chapter, a controlling procedure for voids minimization (quality 
criterion) in soldering process using overpressure module is elaborated. 
There is an agreement between the setup configuration of oven, heating 
transfer factors, and temperature measured on the substrate components. 
A detail study on the soldering oven technology and the controlling 
mechanism for thermal profiling is obtaining the process setup variables 
and heating requirement responses. There are a set of variables, which are 
demonstrating the significance on the quality of soldering process. A set 

83 

Shear force mean (N)



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments 
(DOE) 

 

of experimental design followed by statistical analysis shows the vital 
parameters influencing a void-free soldering process and hence the 
significance of effect.  

From this chapter, the following conclusions are drawn: 

 According to the investigated experiments, reflows peak 
temperature, waiting time until the first overpressure (TAL), and 
the measure of overpressure level are demonstrated with 
significant interaction on void ratio. The regression analysis 
demonstrates R2 value of 81.40%. This value explains that the 
model including the studied process variables (deduced from 
DOE) with the highest significance and coincidence measure of 
81.40% fits the void ratio data well. 18.60% are influencing 
variables such as the solder printing machines and the dynamic 
process variables in soldering process, which are not considered in 
this study. 

 Temperature profile 7 (250 °C, 4 bar, 20 sec) with lowest standard 
deviation shows the lowest average void ratio of 4.54%, and 
temperature profile 3 (250 °C, 0 bar, 60 sec) demonstrate the 
largest void ratio of 28.34%. 

 The first overpressure build-up is decelerating the new gas 
formations in the solder joint, and by the pressure release, the 
existing voids or the trapped gases are exhausted out of the solder 
joint leading to reduce voids. The significance analysis 
demonstrates that pressure has the highest significance in the 
magnitude of the effect on reduction of void ratio. Temperature 
and waiting time parameters are also showing their significance in 
the next levels. 

 The pressure of inside void bubble gas is contributed directly by 
the evaporation of flux and associated solvent and it depends on 
the temperature. The pressure of atmosphere is prohibiting the 
void to grow, and on the other hand, if the temperature of flux is 
reaching to the equilibrium, it stops evaporating and hence the 
voids stop growing. Therefore, the void ratio is less at the waiting 
time of 20 seconds comparing with 60 seconds.  

 At the temperature of 250 °C, the increase of waiting time 
significantly effect on the increase of void ratio, however the 
waiting time has not much effect on void formation increase in 
other two higher temperature levels. Likewise, the pressure 

84 



4.3   Conclusion 
 
 

increase straightly decrease the void fraction at the temperature of 
250 °C, however the effect of pressure changes in other two 
temperature levels are not much significant. 

 If the bigger voids have enough reflow time to reach the surface, 
and/or if the temperature is increasing to certain state, bigger 
voids are able to escape and hence the incidence of voiding is 
reduced. The high incidence of voiding with lower temperature is 
thought to be due to the inferior wetting that left a lot of non-
wetted areas to which a bubble could attach and less time for the 
trapped bubble to escape from the molten solder during the time 
above liquidus. In contrary, the higher incidence of voiding with 
the high reflow profile is thought to be due to the higher 
incidence of non-wetted areas because of the exhaustion of flux 
activity during the longer TAL. However, by the extensive increase 
of waiting time above liquidus at higher temperature (300 °C, 60 
sec) deduce the decrease of void ratio. 

 For the shear force test, the statistical fit general linear model 
analysis is explaining the 43.25% of variation of shear force results, 
and hence the model does not demonstrate a linear interrelation 
with void ratio for further interpretation. The solder joints for 
resistors are might be too small to follow the mechanisms of void 
formation. Most research agrees that voids by themselves are not a 
reliability concern but rather the location of the voids within the 
solder joint that determines their negative impact, if any, on the 
reliability of the joint. Voids forming at the intermetallic layers 
and interfacial surfaces near the base metals of the component 
metal can be the stress concentration points for cracking during 
aging or shear force test [195]. 

 The optical inspection of solder joints demonstrates a constant 
number and size of solder balls across the joints of resistors and 
non on the other electronic components. Solder balls could be 
caused by a too high heating gradient. However other relevant 
defects caused by this flaw are not seen, and therefore, solder 
paste residues caused by stencil printing machine should be the 
main reason. 

An alternative technology for overpressure soldering to target the voids 
creation below 5% is vacuum vapor phase technology. It is inferred that 
overpressure reduces the outgassing of voids significantly whereas the 
negative pressure and vacuum process accelerates it. The melting 

85 



4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments 
(DOE) 

 

temperature of the solder is not affected by the pressure change, but the 
atmospheric pressure influences the boiling temperature of the solvent 
significantly. After melting the solder material, the overpressure profiles 
show a much higher amount of voids in the solder joint than the profiles 
with negative pressure. For both vacuum and overpressure profiles, the 
number of voids does not change significantly during the pressure release. 
The higher the pressure, the slower the reaction gets. Therefore, vacuum 
support the reduction of oxides by the flux and overpressure process 
hinders it. It is inferred that vacuum processes exhibit a better wetting 
behavior of the solder than overpressure processes.  

A pressure change does not stop the chemical reaction of the flux and 
thus the production of gas. The formation of new voids does only stop 
when either one of the reactants is empty or the joint is cooled below 
melting temperature, and the cooling of the solder joints causes the voids 
to shrink. The results for overpressure soldering demonstrated that a 
smaller void area can be achieved with shorter TAL as this minimizes the 
vaporization of flux volatiles during the reflow stage of the profile. The 
results for ramp to peak in reflow zone and short TAL profiles indicated 
that preheat appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of voiding 
as this allows excess volatiles to escape before reflow begins. Therefore, as 
expected, a shorter TAL and a lower peak reflow temperature might well 
minimize the likelihood of gas being generated by decomposition of flux 
constituents in voids trapped at non-wetted areas. 

The influence of overpressure process during the complete peak time 
accelerated the IMP formation rate compared to vacuum vapor phase 
soldering. Though vacuum process soldering demonstrate advantages 
with void reduction, overpressure soldering emerges as a dominant 
mechanism for both void reduction and IMP formation at the same time 
[196]. In addition, the linear reduction of void ratio by the increase of 
overpressure shows that even the application of overpressure more than 4 
bar could reduce the voids less than 4%.  

The drawbacks for vacuum soldering refers to the selection of solder 
material, because some flux ingredients incline to extreme foaming so 
that the components can be uplifted or replaced. Also, PCB materials and 
also some components are tending to excessive outgassing in vacuum. 
Some electrolyte capacitors cannot tolerate the vacuum process because 
of the hermetically enclosed liquids. Another drawback is that heat 
transfer in the vacuum soldering cannot be done with the usual 
convection heating but only by means of infrared radiation or heat

4.3   Conclusion 
 
 

conduction. The assemblies have to be heated sufficiently during this 
soldering process, so that the solder is still liquid in the following vacuum 
process. The overpressure soldering process allows heating of assemblies 
with forced gas convection, low temperature differences (delta T), and a 
controlled heating process. Moreover, outgassing materials and leaking 
components are not likely to result from a soldering process with elevated 
pressure. Less mechanical technology construction is required to reach 
overpressure range from 1–4 bar, and hence void release. 

Similar for vapor phase technology principles, there are recent 
advancements for reflow soldering oven combined with vacuum modules. 
In this technology, to ensure a minimum thermal exposure it is essential 
to achieve a fast transition from the preheating zone into the vacuum 
area, which requires a powerful lock, and pump system as well as 
optimum vacuum pressure during the time when the solder material is 
still above the liquidus. Hence, it is inferred that any of vacuum and 
overpressure processes for a void-free solder joint has advantages and 
disadvantage which a compromised decision defines the best solution.

5 Controlling Procedure for Resource 
Consumption of Soldering Process  

The resource consumption of a specific process is dynamic and highly 
depending on the process configuration of the machine. The cumulative 
load profiles of all machines in the production line are defining the total 
resource consumption for the product. However, the specific power 
consumption behavior of a process chain can be significantly influenced 
by its specific technical configuration and the process setup and control 
[54]. This includes the individual machine chain, their interlinkage (e.g. 
process chain structure, buffers) as well as aspects like planning, 
scheduling of orders (e.g. start time, capacity allocation) or flow of 
production. In addition to the production chain there is auxiliary 
equipment that is supporting the main body of the process chain. Also for 
the soldering process technologies, the dynamics of the interlinked 
production process and the interdependency of auxiliary equipment 
should be measured, analyzed and hence controlled.  

Analysis of the resource flow for the machine and the auxiliary equipment 
in the process however is illustrating the quantity of the flow and hence 
the measure of consumption, but it does not illustrate the quality of 
resource transformation in the soldering process. Exergy analysis method 
is used to study the minimum amount of the required resources to 
complete the soldering process. Therefore, first, a transparency model is 
developed which is illustrating the flow of electrical energy of the oven 
technology and periphery equipment. To build such a model for soldering 
process, a keen understanding of the technical process systems and the 
technology is mandatory. Then, a simulation tool is utilized by means of 
imitation purposes in order to consider the predictable and non-
predictable process breaks in the total power consumption of soldering 
process in this case study. By realizing the resource flow balance of the 
process, an exergy method is conducted and the investigation is followed 
by statistical analysis. The analysis is presented by a meta-model to 
discuss the most significant parameters which are influencing on the final 
resource consumption on periphery levels. This enables the saving 
potentials for resource consumption of the soldering process. 

89 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

5.1 Development of Resource Transparency Model for 
Soldering Process 

To assist in the effort to transparent the resource flow model, the 
soldering process is broken into ‘levels of study’ across four levels, as 
shown in Table 8. The elements in these levels are illustrating the 
equipment that is directly and indirectly connected with the material 
transformation in soldering process. Furtherly, the study of resource 
consumption for periphery levels is combined with a model proposed by 
Schenk et al. [197] which is elaborating the transparency model shown in 
Figure 34. For soldering process, including not only the oven itself, but 
also the auxiliary surrounding equipment obtains a big picture for the 
resource flow transparency. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate all 
supporting facilities of the peripheral systems of the oven, and thus their 
electrical energy consumption and the supplied resources. 

Table 8: Resource consumption levels for soldering process 

Level Description 

Product level The resource input for the material transformation in the soldering 
process, e.g. heaters that are generating the thermal process. 

Periphery 1 The mechanical parts power consumption of the oven technology, 
e.g. convection fans and blowers, and transportation bands. 

Periphery 2 The auxiliary-specific power consumption of equipment, which are 
supplying the auxiliary resources, e.g. gas compressors. 

Periphery 3 The power consumption of supporting facilities in factory level, e.g. 
environment humidity and air conditioning system. 

In the ‘product level’, the exergy method is used to illustrate the 
minimum energy input needed to perform the material transformation in 
soldering process. The ‘first periphery’ is illustrating the resource 
transparency for the mechanical part of the oven, which mostly have to do 
with the kinetic of the oven technology. The ‘second periphery’ is 
considering the auxiliary equipment of the oven, which are supplying 
mainly the resources into the technology. The analysis of this periphery 
mainly yields the power consumption of the auxiliary equipment, which 
are affected massively by the production states (time-based power 
consumption variables) and energy states (power requirement intensity) 
of the oven. The ‘third periphery’ is addressing the electrical energy

Figure 34: The resource transparency model for soldering process 

The resource transparency model reveals the resource flow dependency 
on the oven production state and the power consumption of the auxiliary 
equipment. Using this model and a simulation tool the power 
consumption in all peripheries will be measured and calculated. 

5.2 Analysis of the Electrical Energy Consumption  

The periphery auxiliary equipment is consuming electrical energy to 
supply the demanded resources by the oven. The accumulation of 
auxiliary power consumption for the oven technology is obtaining the 
total power consumption of the system. The total power consumption is 
correlated to production lead-time per product. Hence, by mapping the 
resource flow into the oven, the corresponding electrical energy 
consumption of the supply systems in the periphery levels are 
investigated, and the analysis is followed by the cost calculation per PCB.  

91 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

5.2.1 Measurement of Production Lead-time for Soldering 
Process 

The resource consumption is correlated with the increment of production 
lead-time. There are many definitions of production lead-time, but in the 
present work, it is defined as when the PCB goes into the oven in the first 
zone and it is delivered after the cooling zone. The lead-time in the oven 
is depending on the setup parameter for the speed of transport bands and 
waiting time in the overpressure chamber. As shown in Figure 35, the 
transport bands speed for all profiles are constant; however, they are 
changing corresponding with the change of waiting time in the peak zone. 
The production lead-time in the overpressure chamber is the ‘process 
pacemaker’5. Reduction of processing time in the chamber is reducing the 
entire production lead-time for soldering process and hence the time for 
the entire production line. The given production lead-time does not 
consider the profiles setup time and warm-up process time, however they 
are considered for electrical energy consumption analysis in the 
simulation process when the production status is changing. 

 
Figure 35: Production lead-time per PCB

 Any process along a value stream that sets the pace for the entire stream. (The 

pacemaker process should not be confused with a bottleneck process, which necessarily 
constrains downstream processes due to a lack of capacity.) This point is called the 
pacemaker process, because how you control production at this process sets the pace for 
all the upstream processes [193]. 

92 



5.2   Analysis of the Electrical Energy Consumption 
 
 

5.2.2 Analysis of the Oven Technology for Electrical Energy 
Utilization 

The power consuming components of the oven consists of 11 heaters in 
preheating zone, two heaters and 6 quartz auxiliary heaters in the peak 
zone, and 15 motors for convection blowers and three transport bands. 
After that the oven is turned-on, the power consumption during the 
warm-up process decreases by 80% of the initial consumption after 110 
minutes. During the warm-up process, each heater runs with nearly the 
maximum power consumption possible to reach the setup temperature. 
The temperatures in preheating zones reach the setup temperatures after 
9 to 12 minutes, and thereafter a rapid reduction of the total energy 
consumption is measured. The setup temperature in the peak zone is 
being reached after 30 minutes of warm-up process. As soon as the 
temperature at each zone reaches 10 °C less than the setup temperature, 
the heater starts to oscillate and hence consumes less and less electrical 
energy. Subsequent to the initial state of the oven, the total electrical 
energy consumption reaches a constant value after 110 minutes. The 
completion of warm-up process illustrates that the oven is in operational 
state. The measured values by the power monitor are plotted using the 
excel tool. Figure 36 is showing the load profiles for the temperature 
profiles 25 and 19.

5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

These two profiles are demonstrating the same machine setup with 
different pressure build-up. The two incident increase of peak 
consumptions are illustrating the electrical consumption due to two 
pressure build-up and pressure release for profile 25, however the profile 
19 presents no pressure change and hence the electrical energy load stays 
rather constant.  

Due to specific thermal treatment process of overpressure chamber, this 
zone yields the longest throughput time in the oven and therefore it is the 
pacemaker process. The production lead-time of the entire soldering 
process is mainly affected by the waiting time in the chamber. Depending 
on the changes from 20, 40, and 60 seconds of waiting time, therefore the 
number of PCB products that could be processed in the preceding 
preheating zone is changing. The total numbers of PCBs, which are 
processed at the same time in the oven, are correspondent to the waiting 
time setup and therefore 2.95, 2.72 and 2.54 PCBs. The measured power 
consumption for a specific production time hence is divided into the 
corresponding number of PCBs in the oven, and the electrical energy 
consumption per each profile and per each zone is shown in Figure 37. 
The overpressure zone/peak zone, in average, consumes 62% of the total 
electrical energy. The preheating zone consumes 27% and the cooling 
zone 12% of the total power consumption respectively.

5.2   Analysis of the Electrical Energy Consumption 
 
 

5.2.3 Analysis of the Periphery Levels for Resource Flow-
Related Electrical Energy Consumption 

The electrical energy usage of auxiliary equipment in periphery levels of 
the machine for lighting, compressed air, nitrogen, air conditioning, and 
the cooling water systems are included in the total power consumption 
analysis. The lighting and air conditioning power consumptions are 
calculated per area in which the oven is installed, and other resources are 
calculated per production lead-time. To calculate the electrical energy 
utilized by periphery auxiliaries, first the resource mass consumption 
ratio per PCB should be calculated and the respective dynamic electrical 
energy consumption by the equipment is obtained through the simulation 
model in the next chapter. 

Two ceiling lamp panels illuminate the oven; each consists of 6 
fluorescent tubes with 49 watt output. These are switched-on during the 
entire production process simulation. The consumption of air 
conditioning system is depending on the season to automatically regulate 
the standard temperature in the production hall. Because the air 
conditioning system is only available for the entire building, therefore a 
tool is used to calculate the power consumption per volume of the used 
space by the oven [199]. The water is used as a cooling medium to cool 
down the cooling zone and it is supplied via a cooling tower on the roof of 
the building. The power consumption of the cooling tower is not clear, 
and hence, a cooling system with a similar cooling capacity is considered 
to calculate the average power consumption of this periphery. A closed 
circuit cooler, MCC-MCE A1/A4 cooling tower [200], from Mita Company, 
is considered to estimate the electrical energy consumption value. To 
investigate the utilized cooling water entering into the oven, an ultrasonic 
flow meter is used to measures the velocity of input volume. Using 
ultrasonic transducers, the flow meter can measure the average velocity of 
cooling water along the path of an emitted beam of ultrasound, by 
averaging the difference in measured transit-time between the pulses of 
ultrasound propagating into and against the direction of the water flow. 
The measured flow rate supply of cooling water is about 1.15 m³/h. 

The compressed air supply of the oven is controlled centrally. The 
compressed air system consists of two compressors and two dryers. The 
bigger compressor supplies 1000 liter of compressed air per minute and 
the smaller one 500 l/min. The volume of the air pressure tank is 500 liter, 
and the compressors are switched on automatically when the pressure in 
the tank falls below 6 bar, and it goes to standby when the pressure of the 

95 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

tank reaches 45 bar. Also, for the nitrogen gas supply of the system, an all-
in-one nitrogen skid, from Atlas Copco Company [201], is utilized as a 
guideline. The unit has a tank volume of 1000 liter which is filled with 45 
bar gas pressure. The mass of nitrogen gas input is calculated per number 
and measure of pressure build-up for each profile multiplied by the 240 
liter capacity of the chamber. The air pressure input that is used for 
pneumatic function of the chamber and the mass consumption is 
negligible. 

Figure 38 shows the resource mass consumption per PCB. Because the 
water flow has a rational dependency on production lead-time, it shows a 
similar pattern as the power consumption. The nitrogen gas consumption 
is dependent on the pressure in the overpressure zone; hence it follows 
the pattern per profile setup. When the cooling water accounts for almost 
90% of the mass consumption, nitrogen represents 9.6% and the air 
pressure 0.5%. 

 
Figure 38: Resource mass consumption per PCB 

5.2.4 Development of the Model and Simulation Process to 
Evaluate the Total Electrical Energy Consumption 

In order to control and cope with the dynamics of the process chains, 
simulation method is a promising approach. Discrete Event Simulation 
(DES) could be utilized for a single machine or a highly interactive 
process chain to control the interdependency of the resource flow [202] 
[203] [204]. Three paradigms are introduced in the area of application of 
DES to control the resource flow in manufacturing systems. As shown in 

96 



5.2   Analysis of the Electrical Energy Consumption 
 
 

Figure 39, these paradigms vary depending on the embedding of 
evaluation schemes and/or the interfaces with other simulation tools. The 
particular logic of each approach obtains distinctive advantages and 
disadvantage. According to paradigm A, the simulation approaches is 
offering relatively good coverage of resource flows, comprehensive 
evaluation schemes with relatively low modeling/simulation complexities 
and good transparency for the process. As a drawback, this paradigm 
cannot consider a certain resource oriented dynamics and 
interdependencies in detail. In contrary, paradigm B derives very detailed 
analysis of subsystems and fields of action. However, this approach leads 
to quite complex models which are requiring efforts for transferability. 
Paradigm C as a ‘one-stop solution’ can basically overcome some 
disadvantages of the other two paradigms. As a drawback, this approach is 
potentially restricted by possible limitations of the utilized simulation 
environment. Therefore, combination of the necessary logic to integrate 
the dynamic resource consumption and the strong discrete event and 
material flow oriented perspective is difficult [54]. 

 
Figure 39: Paradigms for simulating resource flow in manufacturing systems [54] 

This study is utilizing the paradigm C to transparent and controls the 
dynamic of the resource flow and to evaluate the power consumption of 
the oven technology and interlinked auxiliary equipment which are 
supporting the main technology during the process. The chosen paradigm 
extends the existing categorization with another aspect: 
transparency/analysis and presentation.  

With the application of such simulation, the series of the data can be 
presented directly in the simulation software or external software plotters. 
On the other hand, the results can be exported into a spreadsheet 
program to use its special features such as graphical representation. 
Essentially, exporting the results has the benefit of further analysis 
without the need for expensive simulation program licenses. Due to the 

97 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

proliferation of spreadsheet software, this presentation of results is easier. 
However, the resulting data can be very large when using load profiles 
with a high temporal resolution. The present approach therefore is able to 
analyze the data internally and export the results; however the export 
function aggregates the records to a maximum size.  

Simulation Process in Tecnomatix® Plant Simulation 12 

Tecnomatix® Plant Simulation software enables the simulation, 
visualization, analysis and optimization of production systems and 
logistics processes. Plant Simulation enables to optimize material flow, 
resource utilization and logistics for all levels of plant planning, from 
global facilities and local plants to specific production lines. Users can 
choose from predefined resources, order lists, operation plans and control 
rules. In the present approach, the discrete event simulation framework 
Plant Simulation is chosen as the core software due to its modular 
expansion options. The extension is implemented as a modular library as 
well as for the energy module. After adding the power module to an 
existing material flow model, all components can be configured with a 
setup dialog of the energy module. In order to implement the desired 
energy simulation, the network oriented modeling of Plant Simulation is 
utilized. In the given context, the term network is defined as the summary 
of several basic elements to a superior object. Using this structure, 
different hierarchical levels of the model network interlinked with the 
resource flow can be simulated.  

As shown in Figure 40, the oven technology is separated into three zones 
modules, and each zone is connected with relevant resource module 
according to transparency model in Figure 34. These modules are 
modeled as a network or a basic material flow element given by Plant 
Simulation. This hierarchical structure is taken advantage of by extending 
Plant Simulation with energy aspects. Hereby the key element is the 
energy module, which is a network consisting of all required elements and 
matching methods to administrate specific power or resource profiles, to 
calculate the total resource consumption of the technology and periphery. 
Once the resource modules have been added to an existing network, all 
relevant material flow elements, located in the same network, are 
automatically detected and linked to the tool. Starting the simulation, not 
only the material flow, but additionally the resource profiles of the linked 
network are protocolled. To fulfill this purpose, observer procedures are 
used which are automatically invoked if changes in the material flow 
simulation occur. Thus, they allow the calculation of resource data 

98 



5.2   Analysis of the Electrical Energy Consumption 
 
 

without changing already existing methods as well as for the material flow 
model. 

 
Figure 40: The simulation process model for the total power consumption 

The event controller is used to start the simulation and to set the speed 
and scheduling. The energy analyzer makes it possible to analyze the 
resource consumption of the individual systems in the model. The 
production run and scheduling, as well as breaks, are defined by the shift 
calendar. The simulation is planned for five weeks, starts on Monday at 
6:00 am and ends on Saturday at 6:00 am, each day three shifts, and one 
hour break time is scheduled per each shift. In the simulation model, the 
source is defined for the oven that supplies the machine with the product 
and a sink for the finished goods. The source is controlled via delivery list 
to show the entry times of the various production events based on the 
production lead-time of temperature profiles. For each zone in the oven, 
the power consumption is defined according to the measured values. 
Additionally, a distinction is made between the various production states 
of the oven: Working, Setting-up, Operational, Failed, Standby, and Off. 
During the setup, the oven goes to the ‘Setting-up’ state and ‘Failed’ in 
case of disturbance or breakage. After setup, the machine is ready for 

99 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

operation. In this state, it is waiting until a PCB arrives. During the 
working process, the status of the oven changes to ‘Working’ and then to 
the ‘Operational’ state. The machine goes to the ‘Standby’ state during the 
intermittent periods and break times, and for a non-working weekend, 
the oven is in ‘Off’ state and consume no resource. Hence, the individual 
states of the oven are considered for the simulation application and not 
the average power consumption.  

For the periphery levels in the simulation model only two states where 
applied. The ‘Working’ state and 30% of this value, which is used for 
‘Operational’ state. The cooling water system in the simulation process is 
supplying at intervals of each 3.66 hours during working production 
process. The compressed air unit has a power demand of 13 kW during the 
production process and 3.9 kW in standby state of the unit. The 
compressed air supply in simulation process is operating each 0.96 hours 
during the working production state. The nitrogen supply system has a 
power demand of 26 kW during the production process and 7.8 kW in 
standby state. Figure 41 shows the total power consumption of the 
peripheral equipment for each temperature profile per PCB. In average, 
the air compressor unit is consuming 56.4%, and the nitrogen compressor 
unit 43.4% of the total peripheral power consumption and the influence 
of waiting time in all profiles are significant. The average power 
consumption for cooling water accounts for 0.19% of the total 
consumption, whereas the lights and air conditioning are negligible with 
a share less than 0.01%.

5.3 Thermodynamic Process Investigation of the 
Energy Efficiency Using Exergy Analysis 

After analysis of power consumption for the oven technology and the 
peripheries, exergy method is employed to investigate the quality of 
resource transformation in soldering process in the product level. To 
enable an exergy analysis, the comparison with a reference environment is 
initially necessary. The reference environment is comprised of 
temperature, pressure, atmospheric compositions and other reference 
values. To conduct the calculations, as shown in Table 9,  a reference 
temperature of 25 °C, an atmosphere pressure of 1.01325 bar, a relative 
humidity of 70% and an atmospheric composition of N2, O2 and others are 
setup [90] [205].

5.3.1 Defining the Resource Flow for the Subsystem 
Boundaries 

Exergy value only exists in comparison to the reference state, the setup of 
the system and subsystem boundaries. Hence, as shown in Figure 42, the 
oven technology is divided in three zones; Preheating zone, overpressure 
chamber and cooling zone. Environment is also regarded as the fourth 
subsystem. Each subsystem is investigated for the resource input and 
output, and the values are shown in Table 10. The parameters in the 
preheating and cooling zones are remaining constant; however, values in 
overpressure zone are varying according to the setup parameters defined 
in the DOE in chapter 4.2.3.

5.3.2 Calculation of the Resource Mass and Exergy Flow 

All the resource supply including material, electrical energy, and PCB 
components entering and leaving the oven carry exergy into and out of 
the system. Before calculating the exergy flow and balancing it, it is 
necessary to determine the type of exergy which is carried by each 
resource. As with many other production machines, the reflow oven does 
neither produce electrical work nor obtain it. It is also assumed that the 
heat transfer across system boundaries does not occur in the reflow oven. 
The exceptions are losses due to insufficient isolation or radiation, which 
is included in the total exergy loss.  

102 



5.3   Thermodynamic Process Investigation of the Energy Efficiency Using Exergy Analysis 
 
 

A comprehensive explanation on the exergy calculation procedure is given 
in chapter 2.2.3. To calculate the exergy of resource input and output, 
their specific exergy values are calculated. These values differ for each 
temperature profile because of the pressure and temperature differences 
as well as due to the difference of resource flows. The actual exergy is 
determined by multiplying the mass of a resource type with their standard 
exergy values [93].  

Chapter 5.2.3 is explaining the calculation approach for the resource flow, 
and the resource flow Sankey diagram for temperature profile 1 is shown 
in Figure 43. From this diagram, it defers that water has by far the largest 
proportion. This also applies for other temperature profiles. Nitrogen gas 
and compressed air is the product of supply systems and the compressors. 
The mass of nitrogen gas is dependent on the applied pressure and it 
changes from 1 kg to 4 kg. The mass of compressed air flow is not 
changing but its pressure. The mass of PCB and the electronic 
components remain constant. 

 
Figure 43: Resource flow for temperature profile 1 (kg)  

The exergy of material resources and PCB is the sum of the chemical and 
physical exergy of its individual components. Once the resource flow for 
all profiles are realized, the input and output values should be studied. 
The chemical and physical exergy of the corresponding resources will be 
calculated referring to their flow amount.  

The nitrogen and compressed air supplier systems are consuming 
electrical energy (100% exergy), to deliver the input nitrogen and 
pressurized air gases. The total exergy balances for these resource gases 
are calculated. For instance, a detailed example for exergy analysis of 
resource material for temperature profile 1 is tabulated in Table 11. Also by 
utilizing the specific chemical exergy of the PCB assembly chemical 
components in Table 12, the total exergy of PCB product is calculated.

5.3.3 Balancing and Calculation of the Exergy Loss and 
Destruction 

After all resource flows are determined, an exergy balance is conducted to 
make the exergy loss visible by adding up the differences of electrical 
work, physical and chemical exergy. The chemical exergy loss is 
considered zero, as the mass flow is constant in the system. The electrical 
exergy provided to the process is converted primarily into heat and 
mechanical work, and during the energy conversion process a big amount 
of useful energy is dissipated as heat and friction, and hence it is directly 
accounted to the loss. The exergy loss is calculated by the equation 24.

5.3   Thermodynamic Process Investigation of the Energy Efficiency Using Exergy Analysis 
 
 

Figure 44 shows the exergy Sankey diagram for the temperature profile 1. 
This diagram shows the sum of physical and chemical exergy per each 
resource input and output described in Table 11 and Table 12. During the 
reflow soldering process, little to no chemical reaction takes place, and no 
material is added onto the PCB during the solder process. Therefore, the 
chemical exergy for material streams flowing into the system is 1370.16 kJ 
and it is calculated as to be the same as the chemical exergy flowing out of 
the system. Because the PCB enters the oven with ambient temperature, 
and cooled down at the end of the process to nearly the same 
temperature. Therefore, as shown in Table 13, the PCB obtains 351.70 kJ 
exergy in the first zone, and it is changing during the process in the next 
zones, however it carries almost no physical exergy when it leaves the 
oven.

For a unit PCB assembly, the total electrical energy of 3247.9 kJ is 
consumed to produce about 199.04 kJ of nitrogen and 0 kJ air pressure. 
The efficiency of auxiliary gas suppliers for profile 1 is 6.5% (for all profiles 
are shown in Table 14). The exergy carried by the nitrogen gas into the 
oven is 199.04 kJ, and it is reduced to 77.34 kJ after utilization in reflow 
soldering. Air output obtains a very small fraction of physical exergy 
which is neglected as zero exergy. In addition, 3703.7 kJ of electrical 
energy is fully utilized by the oven in soldering process to produce the 
thermal process. The electrical energy used by the oven and periphery are 
simulated and calculated in capital 5.2.4, and it is mainly constituting the 
exergy loss after exergy balancing.

5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

For cooling water, the exergy content remains almost intact, with a small 
exergy obtain of 19.9 kJ. Cooling water is recycled but the exergy of air and 
nitrogen stream carry their resource intensities, which may cause local 
disturbances when dumped into the environment. Since physical exergy 
of water constitutes a small value, the most of their exergy would be 
reutilized. But the exergy of the exhausted air or nitrogen are transferred 
to the surroundings often without any use. The exergies of the 
compressed air out may include a very small portion of physical exergy 
(chemical exergy will not significantly differ at the exit from the value at 
the inlet) which may indicate a measure of a resource spent (availability 
of compressed air used for the process).  

5.3.4 Definition of Exergy Efficiency Indicators and Analysis 

Once the exergy balance of resource flows is illustrated, the efficiency 
definition is deployed to define the exergy efficiency indicators. The sum 
of associated exergy input carried by nitrogen and air to total electrical 
energy consumed by the supply systems and compressors are delivering 
the exergy efficiency of these systems. 5.1% is the minimum and 19.6% is 
the maximum obtained efficiency. 

In the case of the exergy efficiency of the soldering oven, two types of 
efficiencies are considered. The total exergy efficiency (ƞ𝑛𝑒𝑡,𝑚𝑎 ), which is 
the ratio of the exergy flowing out of the system and the accumulation of 
all exergy flowing into the system (Eq. 25). This takes all exergy streams 
into account, such as the exergy carried by PCB and cooling water when 
entering and leaving the system boundaries. Nitrogen gas and pressurized 
air is the product of supplier systems, and hence the total electrical energy 
consumption of periphery is included as the exergy input.  

𝐸𝑋𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑂𝑢𝑡 = ƞ

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝐼𝑛

The product exergy efficiency (ƞ𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡) is based on the amount of exergy 
carried by the PCB. This efficiency describes how much of the entire 
exergy input into the oven is utilized by the final product (Eq. 26). This 
indicator illustrates the minimum amount of available energy which the 
PCB is requiring during the soldering process, and hence the rest are 
considered as non value-added available energy.

The efficiency indicators for all profiles are shown in Table 14. This table 
illustrates that the lowest total exergy efficiency is 20.3% for temperature 
profile 21 (300 °C, 0 bar, 60 sec), and the highest value is obtained by the 
temperature profile 16 (285 °C, 4 bar, 20 sec) with the efficiency of 28.6%. 
The product exergy efficiency shows the lowest value of 11.7% for the 
profile 27 (300 °C, 4 bar, 60 sec), and 15.4% as the highest value for the 
profile 1 (250 °C, 0 bar, 20 sec).

5.3.5 Statistical Analysis and Meta-model Development for 
Electrical Energy Consumption 

The statistical analysis using Minitab software is conducted to investigate 
the effect of parameter setup and their interactions on the electrical

5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

energy consumption of the oven technology and its peripheries. The 
significance analysis results are shown in Table 15. The electrical energy 
consumption meta-model for the oven technology shows that the 
measurements with the accuracy of 95.50% (R2 value) are explaining the 
fitted model. From the analysis, R2 prediction value of 91.85% is close 
enough to R2 value to emphasize on the reliability of the model for further 
prediction usage. As a rule of thumb, if the R2 value is more than 0.90 and 
the value of the adjusted or predicted R2 is more than 0.80, the fitted 
model will be considered adequate and each model provides sufficient 
explanation capability. According to the analysis, the waiting time factor 
is statistically significant with the highest effect, and temperature in the 
next level with lower effect. The pressure parameter is statistically less 
significant. By the prolongation of waiting time in the process, the 
electrical energy consumption linearly is increasing. The interaction of 
waiting time with temperature is however significant but with less effect 
on the electrical energy of the oven. 

The fitted model for the electrical energy consumption of auxiliary 
equipment in peripheries, indicating the R2 value of 99.63% and R2 
predication value of 99.36%. Therefore, the given data for this model are 
highly reliable for analysis of variance and significance analysis. 
Temperature is showing absolutely no significance because the electrical 
energy consumption of the oven has no effect on the electrical energy 
consumption in periphery level. The pressure and waiting time factors 
with the highest effect are highly statistically significant. The compressors 
in periphery level with considerable electrical energy consumption 
support the nitrogen production. By the increase of waiting time, the 
cooling water consumption and therefore the corresponding equipment 
electrical energy consumption is increasing. The interactions of setup 
parameters in periphery levels are absolutely not significant. 

The cumulative electrical energy consumption of all peripheries and the 
oven technology level is shown in total electrical energy in Table 15. The 
R2 value of 98.62% is describing that all considered parameters in all 
peripheries are very well explaining the value of total electrical energy 
consumption, and the R2 predication value of 97.46% illustrates the 
reliability of the model for further predictions and interpretation 
purposes. The significance analysis deduces that all setup parameters are 
highly statistically significant, and elongation of waiting time is extremely 
influencing on the total electrical energy consumption. The interaction of 
waiting time with other two factors however is significant but less 
effective.

Metamodeling typically involves studying the output, input relationships, 
and then fitting right meta-models to represent that behavior. As shown 
in Figure 45, the fitted surface plots present the interaction of parameters 
and rational changes as already discussed for the statistical analysis. 
Likewise, temperature and pressure are illustrating rather same 
significance and effect. As shown in Figure 45, a), by the change of any 
factor, the other factor displays a rational increase or decrease. The 
significance analysis shows that the effect of waiting time factor on 
responses and specifically the effect on the response in periphery level is 
about 9 times higher than pressure effect and the effect on the total 
electrical energy or power consumption is about 25 times higher than 
other two parameters. Therefore the two contours in Figure 45, b), and 
Figure 45, c) are illustrating similar behavior for the other two factors 
when the waiting time measure is increasing.

5.3.6 Statistical Analysis and Meta-model Development for 
Exergy Efficiency  

Energy is not fully available to do useful work. The real amount of 
available energy will depend on some aspects that it is not feasible to 
energy model. Therefore, the exergy efficiency is revealing the measure of 
efficiency indicator of available energy to benchmark different setup 
profiles. The indicator for the total exergy efficiency is revealing a 
comparison measure for all profiles, and the product exergy efficiency is 
used to investigate the efficiency of the applied resources for the PCB 
product. From the ANOVA analysis for the total exergy efficiency of 27 
profiles, it is inferred that the fitted model is obtaining R2 value of 93.58% 
and R2 predication value of 89.21%. Therefore, the fitted model for the 
exergy efficiency is valid for further explanation. As shown in Table 16, the 
pressure and waiting time are statistically significant; however, no 
significance is realized by the temperature parameter. The pressure factor 
is illustrating the highest effect because the energy intensive compressors 

110 



5.3   Thermodynamic Process Investigation of the Energy Efficiency Using Exergy Analysis 
 
 

in periphery level support this factor. The waiting time factor is 
influencing on the working time of all periphery levels. Therefore, it has 
the highest effect on the electrical energy and equivalent to 100% exergy.

The product exergy efficiency is indicating on the exergy carried/utilized 
by the PCB product when it is completing the soldering processed. The 
fitted model for product exergy efficiency is explaining the 98.39% of data 
variation, and the R2 predication of 97.26% which is close enough to R2 
value for further prove of the model reliability. This efficiency is 
considering the product material components. As seen in Table 16, all 
factors are statistically significant on the product exergy efficiency. The 
chemical exergy of PCB individual substances and therefore the total 
exergy of PCB product for each individual profile are identical and it 
shows the resource intensity of the product. It is assumed that the 
individual PCB components and elements are not chemically interacting 
with each other. But in a reality, it may not be the case. The substances 
react with each other and form intermetallic or intermediate compounds 
at the regions of contact. Moreover, a detail about the kind and intensities 
of the interactions possible within the stream (inside components or PCB 
assembly) is not available. Considering the quantity of the 
chemicals/substances involved, the impact of these quantities in total 
exergy is negligible. The material chemical exergy by the change thermal 

111 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

treatment in different profiles are changing and it obtains a comparable 
efficiency metric for different thermal profiles. 

As opposed to other studied performance factors, the total exergy 
efficiency should be maximized. From the surface plots in Figure 46, it is 
inferred that the change of temperature is not affecting on the efficiency, 
but the increase of pressure has rather a linear effect. In addition, the 
figures are explaining that how the decrease of waiting time is affecting 
positively on the efficiency response. The pressure factor points out the 
most effective significance at 4 bar and the combination with 20 seconds 
of waiting time for efficiency increase in Figure 46, c) is noticeable.

The multi-vari chart in Figure 47 is illustrating that the magnitude of 
exergy efficiency is slightly increasing when the waiting time is shortened. 
The gradient of the green line is proving this fact. The red lines are 
illustrating that the efficiency magnitude is extensively changing when 
the pressure level is increasing. This fact is proven also by the significance

analysis of pressure parameter. The statistical analysis depicts that the 
pressure changes and waiting time changes have the most significant 
effect on the total exergy efficiency, however the pressure effect is about 6 
times higher than waiting time factor. From the multi-vari chart it is 
perceptible that the highest exergy efficiency for temperatures of 250 °C 
and 285 °C at different levels of pressure are closely changing. The profile 
for 285 °C, 4 bar, and 20 seconds of waiting time obtains the highest 
exergy efficiency of 28.6%.

5.4 Calculation and Statistical Analysis of the Total 
Cost for Soldering Process 

As discussed in chapter 2.2.5, when looking at the short-term 
consumption, only the consumption of process-related material goods, 
resources, electrical energy consumption are relevant. Therefore, the cost 
for the associated resource consumption per one PCB production is 
calculated. The statistical analysis is followed for the cost factor and the 
influencing factors are discussed. 

The total cost for soldering process is comprised of the process-related 
resource consumption, which are changing by the change of temperature 
profiles. The cost for cooling water, 0.001963 € per liter, is calculated 

113 

Total exergy efficiency (%)



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

according to Erlanger Stadtwerke (ESTW) [206]. The cost for electrical 
energy consumption of lights, air conditioner, and the water cooling 
system are negligible. The total cost for cooling water, nitrogen and air 
pressure supply systems, and electrical energy consumption per PCB are 
calculated based on the analysis in chapter 5.2.2 and 5.2.4 and illustrations 
are shown in Figure 48.  

 
Figure 48: Total process cost per PCB product 

The price for electrical energy consumption for industry is about 0.17 € 
per kWh. This price is used to calculate the electrical energy consumption 
costs. Nitrogen and air pressure are the product of supply systems and 
hence the associated power consumption cost for the supply systems are 
representing the price of these resources. The resources for all profiles are 
obtained an accumulative cost from 0.34 € to 0.44 €. The power 
consumption cost for soldering process per PCB, in average, is comprised 
of 51% for oven, 15% for nitrogen supply system, 20% for air pressure 
supply system, and near 10% for cooling water system [207]. This obtains a 
good overview on the cost for overpressure soldering process in SMT 
production industry. The statistical analysis of the total cost is revealing 
the effect of oven setup changes and the respective electrical

Comparing with the Table 8, the cost for auxiliary resources is 
accumulated as periphery cost. By including the setup factors and the cost 
as the response in the analysis, waiting time and pressure are statistically 
significant, and waiting time interaction is contributing 99.21% on the 
total cost of the product. Due to the big contribution of the waiting time 
factor, the setup factors are associated with oven technology and 
periphery cost factors for significance analysis. As shown in Table 17, 
waiting time is highly statistically significant and electrical energy 

115

consumption of the oven and periphery level is rather equally sharing the 
same strong effect on the final cost. The temperature factor is statistically 
insignificant as well as the interaction of this factor with other effective 
factor on the final cost. The pressure factor also is statistically significant, 
but it yields the least effect on the final cost.  

5.5 Conclusion 

This chapter presented a control procedure for the resource flow in the 
overpressure soldering process, and the cost is evaluated. First, a 
transparency model is developed which is illustrating the flow of electrical 
energy of the oven technology and auxiliary equipment in four periphery 
levels. It is inferred that: 

 The transparency model identified the magnitude of resource flow 
for nitrogen gas, compressed air, cooling water, and the associated 
electrical energy cost of the supplier units. Furtherly, the electrical 
energy consumption for air conditioning and the plant 
illumination is studied. PCB product and personnel are considered 
as constant resource consumption factors. 

 The analysis of oven technology is illustrating that once the 
machine is turned-on, the power consumption during the warm-
up process decreases by 80% of the initial consumption after 110 
minutes. The oven is in operational state when the warm-up 
process is ending. During the warm-up process, each heater runs 
with nearly the maximum power consumption possible to reach 
the setup temperature. The temperature in preheating zones reach 
the setup temperatures after 9 to 12 minutes, and it leads to a 
rapid reduction of the total energy consumption. The setup 
temperature in the peak zone is being reached after 30 minutes of 
warm-up process. 

 In the product level for the oven technology, the overpressure 
zone/peak zone, in average, consumes 62% of the total electrical 
energy. The preheating zone consumes 27% and the cooling zone 
12% of the total power consumption per PCB product.  

 In the periphery level, for all consumed resources in unit of 
kilogram, 90% cooling water, 9.6% nitrogen, and 0.5% air pressure 
are consumed per PCB product. 

116 



5.5   Conclusion 
 
 

Then, a simulation tool is utilized by means of imitation purposes in order 
to consider the predictable and non-predictable process breaks in the 
total power consumption of the soldering process. It is inferred that: 

 In average, the air compressor unit is consuming 56.4%, and the 
nitrogen compressor unit 43.4% of the total peripheral power 
consumption. The average power consumption for cooling water 
unit accounts for 0.19% of the total consumption, whereas the 
lights and air conditioning are negligible with a share less than 
0.01%. 

 From the statistical analysis, R2 value of 98.62% is describing that 
the considered setup parameters (deduced from DOE study) in all 
peripheries are very well explaining the value of total power 
consumption response, and the R2 predication value of 97.46% 
illustrates the reliability of the model for further predictions and 
interpretation purposes. The effect of waiting time factor on 
responses in the periphery level is about 9 times higher than 
pressure effect. The effect of waiting factor on the total power 
consumption is about 25 times higher than temperature and 
pressure parameters. 

By realizing the resource flow balance of the process, an exergy method is 
conducted and the investigation is followed by statistical analysis. Energy 
can be consumed and conserved but not all that energy is available to do 
useful work. Therefore, the exergy efficiency is revealing the measure of 
efficiency indicator of available energy to benchmark different setup 
profiles. It is inferred that: 

 During the reflow soldering process, little to no chemical reaction 
takes place, and no material is added during the solder process. 
Therefore, the chemical exergy for material streams flowing into 
the system is considered to be the same as the chemical exergy 
flowing out of the system. Because the PCB demonstrator is cooled 
down at the end of the process to nearly the reference 
temperature, and therefore the final product carries almost no 
physical exergy.  

 Unlike the material flow, the electrical energy, which is 100% 
available form of exergy, is completely consumed in the process. 
Therefore, the electrical energy/ power consumption of the oven 
technology and auxiliary equipment supplying the resources are 

117 



5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process 
 

interacting significantly on the exergy flow of the process. 
Electrical energy is directly converted to exergy loss.  

 From the statistical analysis for the total exergy efficiency, it is 
inferred that the fitted model is obtaining R2 value of 93.58% and 
R2 predication value of 89.21%. Therefore, the fitted model for the 
exergy efficiency is valid for further explanation. The pressure and 
waiting time are statistically significant; however, no significance 
is realized by temperature parameter. The statistical analysis 
depicts that the pressure changes and waiting time changes have 
the most significant effect on the total exergy efficiency.  

 The highest exergy efficiency of 28.6% is obtained by the profile 
with setup profile of 285 °C, 4 bar, and 20 seconds of waiting time. 
The obtained exergy value and the associated setup may point out 
the directions for further technology development. 

Lastly the associated cost for the resource flow per PCB product is 
conducted and the statistical analyses are illustrating the most influential 
factors in overpressure soldering process. Hence, It is inferred that: 

 The resources for all profiles are obtained an accumulative cost 
from 0.34 € to 0.44 €. The power consumption cost for soldering 
process per PCB, in average, is comprised of 51% for oven, 15% for 
nitrogen supply system, 20% for air pressure supply system, and 
10% for cooling water system. 

 Waiting time and in the next level, pressure are statistically 
significant. However, waiting time factor demonstrates 99.21% of 
interaction contribution on the oven and periphery supply 
systems and therefore on the total process cost. The comparative 
analysis of waiting time in different profiles indicates on efficiency 
of overpressure oven technology during the active production 
phases. Comparing with the recent advanced soldering techniques 
such as laser soldering, conductive adhesives which are featuring 
the least resource consumption; this study is a leap forward that 
may impact in diverse domains of sustainability and economic 
impact of overpressure soldering technology.

6 Development of Mathematical Prediction 
Models for Solder Profiles 

The aim of this chapter is to develop reliable models using the DOE data 
input to predict the responses. Hence, the error analysis is conducted and 
the comparison of models is defining the reliable models. The reliable 
models with acceptable errors are deployed, and by the given input setup 
parameters are predicting optimized responses. Predication, optimization, 
and experimental verification of predicted responses are conducted in 
chapter 7.  

The intelligent process optimization methods are reviewed and discussed 
in chapter 2.3. The RSM is a series of mathematical and statistical 
techniques useful for the modeling and analysis of problems in which the 
responses of interest are influenced by several influential factors, and the 
main objective is to optimize their responses. In addition, the ANN is 
obtained trending attention for solving the multi-objective optimizations. 
An ANN method which is also a computational model mimics the 
decision making process through the data learning process. This method 
is used for an approximate mapping of nonlinear relationship between the 
parameter setups and responses considering a randomized distribution of 
data learning process. The ANN and RSM methods firstly are utilized for 
prediction process, and secondly the results are used for comparison 
purposes to check the reliability of any of these methods for the current 
case study application. Any of these methods are following different 
modeling topology process, as illustrated in Figure 49. 

In chapter 4.2.3, the responses of interests including the quality and 
resource efficiency for soldering process through conduction of DOE are 
collected and mathematically modeled. The ANN model is starting with 
definition of input and response parameters, creation of the topology and 
the model architecture. The data training process and the measure of the 
error given by the verified models are demonstrating the reliability of the 
ANN model for the given data series. The RSM model is created based on 
the given solutions by the software, and hence after definition of the 
problem, input and response data, the reliability of the model are verified 
by the obtained set of statistical data. Once the reliabilities of models are 
proven, the experimental input data are used for the prediction 
application. The deviations of the predicted values with the results from 
experiments are demonstrating the error ratios of developed model. Upon 

119

the accuracy of the developed model, it may help to explain the soldering 
process system and to study the effects of different components, and to 
make predictions about the profiling behavior.  

 
Figure 49: The structure of the mathematical modeling approach 

6.1 Modeling of the Criteria using Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN) Method 

ANN is used, first, to optimize the relation between the input parameters 
and responses in soldering process. Three models are individually 
developed for the void ratio, total electrical energy consumption and the 
exergy efficiency. The verified reliable models are utilized for prediction 
applications and to prove the optimized parameters setup. To build up 
the ANN model, a set of requirements are fulfilled which are discussed in 
the next subchapter.  

6.1.1 Development of the ANN Models 

The neural network modeling requires several parameters to adjust the 
topology of the network. According to the steepest gradient along the 

120 



6.1   Modeling of the Criteria using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Method 
 
 

error surface, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPN) is the best-known 
supervised technique for adjusting randomized weights during the data-
learning phase.  As shown in Figure 50, the BPN has input, hidden, and 
output layers. In order to design a BPN model, parameters should be 
defined including: the number of data-learning iterations; the learning 
rate; momentum; the number of hidden layers; and the number of 
processing elements in the hidden layer. There are some general 
recommendations on the setup of these parameters, but there is no 
universally proven criterion to define an appropriate network topology. 
Defining a high performance ANN design is not straightforward and it 
depends on the appropriate selections of network topology and 
parameters, and therefore there is a trade-off between mapping 
performance and computational complexity of the model. The profiling of 
the reflow soldering process is nonlinear and complex, and hence 
feedforward BPN algorithm is useful to map the cause and effect 
relationship of input setups and responses (void ratio, total power 
consumption, and total exergy efficiency). A high performance ANN 
model is used for further prediction purposes that are attributed with an 
acceptable error, a good performance, and an acceptable response data 
regression. 

 
Figure 50: Architecture of ANN model for soldering process profiling 

121 



6   Development of Mathematical Prediction Models for Solder Profiles 
 

Temperature, pressure, and waiting time are defined as three input 
neurons. Depending on which response is going to be modeled, any of 
void ratio, or power consumption, or total exergy efficiency is chosen as 
the response neuron. As the rule of thumb, the number of hidden layers 
should be somewhere between the number of input and output layer, and 
in most problems one hidden layer is optimal. The number of neurons for 
the hidden layer also should not exceed twice the number of input nodes; 
otherwise an overfitting will be experienced at this point. However, these 
rules are not universal and a set of trial and error tries are revealing the 
best models with the least occurred error. For all models, Conjugate 
Gradient Backpropagation (CGB) with powell-beale restarts algorithm is 
selected as training function and Gradient Descent with Momentum 
(GDM) weight and bias learning function with default Momentum 
constant of 0.9 and Learning rate of 0.01. 

The MATLAB® software package is utilized to develop the ANN 
architecture and model. The neural network toolbox is used to set up and 
find the best training dataset. The input data and response are defined. 
The given data for 27 experiments were randomly separated into three 
groups; 70% for training the data, 15% for testing samples, and 15% for 
validation. A final ANN topology for the hidden layers and neurons and 
an output layer with the Sigmoid transfer function is designated to train 
and test the experimental data with a limit of 10,000 epochs for all 
models. According to the trial and error experiments for any of the 
responses, one hidden layer and 4 neurons are identified for the best 
model performance before overfitting occurs. The Figure 51 is illustrating 
the training process flow chart for ANN modeling.  

 
Figure 51: Training process flow chart for ANN modeling 

After training the model, the Mean of Squared Errors (MSE) is checked for 
the network performance function measure. By the evaluation of different 

122 



6.1   Modeling of the Criteria using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Method 
 
 

trial and error setups for the ANN topology, the least MSE value should be 
realized and hence it verifies the model if the performance of the model is 
acceptable or not. In parallel, the regression plot (Figure 52) for the 
trained data is proving the verification of the final model. If the regression 
is acceptable and therefore if the regression accuracy is high enough, the 
model is reliable for further prediction applications. 

6.1.2 Application and Verification of ANN Models 

To develop the ANN model, three input parameters are chosen, and 
responses are selected according to the aim of the study. First, the void 
ratio is selected as the response for the first model. One hidden layer and 
four hidden neurons are defining the topology of the model. The model 
for this topology will be several times trained to obtain the best validation 
performance with the MSE of 0.13872. In parallel, as shown in Figure 52, 
the regression plots are examined to check if the training performance of 
the data in this model is satisfactory.  

 
Figure 52: Regression plot of training, validation and test 

123 



6   Development of Mathematical Prediction Models for Solder Profiles 
 

In each plot, the dashed line represents the perfect result, i.e. 
outputs equal targets, whereas the solid line corresponds to the best-fit 
linear regression. As R-value approaches to one, then there is an exact 
linear relationship. The regression results (R-value) for training, 
validation and test are 0.95065, 0.99869 and 0.99663, respectively. Those 
results were corresponding to a total regression of 0.96963. The high 
accuracy of trained model associated with low MSE demonstrates the 
reliability of this model for prediction application. 

The above explained process approach for modeling and verification of 
the ANN models for all three responses are performed and the results are 
shown in Table 18. The verified models with demonstrated MSEs are 
conforming to the reliability of the ANN models for further prediction 
applications.

6.2 Modeling of the Criteria using Response Surface 
Method (RSM) and Verification of Models 

In the optimization process, likewise ANN approach, RSM quantifies the 
relationship between the input variables and the response surfaces, and it 
finds the optimal solution sets with the highest desirability according to 
the given response surface design. RSM method is following three 
solution approaches. In comparison with Central Composite design, the 
Box-Behnken design is considering combinations that are at the 
midpoints of the edges of the experimental space and it requires at least 
three continuous factors. Central Composite designs usually have axial 
points that may not be in the region of interest, or may be impossible to 
conduct because they are beyond safe operating limits. The Box-Behnken 
design is identifying all design points fall within the safe operating zone. 
In comparison with the two above, the third solution, the Full Factorial 
design is the most useful and powerful in explorations of the factor space 
to identify the region of optimal response because it is considering every 
combination of factor levels. Through the screening process, the safe 

124 



6.2   Modeling of the Criteria using Response Surface Method (RSM) and Verification of 
Models 

 
 
operation zones for overpressure soldering oven are known, and they are 
identified with the maximum, minimum and midpoint for each 
parameter. This study deployed the Full Factorial design to create and 
analyze the response surface. 

Minitab® software is utilized to conduct the RSM. After identifying the 
designs for which the experimental data should be analyzed, the 
continuous factors (input process parameters), categorical factors 
(categorical classification of data), as well as the responses are defined. 
The RSM is producing a mathematical model, which correlate the input 
parameters and responses according to a polynomial equation. This 
equation is containing coefficients, which are describing the size and 
direction of the relationship between a term in the model and the 
response variable. To minimize multicollinearity among the terms, the 
coefficients are all in coded units, and they are shown in Table 19.

In a polynomial equation of a response, the coefficient for a term 
represents the change in the mean response associated with an increase of 
one coded unit in that term, while the other terms are held constant. The 
sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between 
the term and the response. As for the void ratio in Table 19, the coefficient 
for interaction of pressure among other continuing factors is the highest 
and then pressure has the highest effect. Interaction of temperature and 
pressure is proving their high effect comparing with other interaction 
terms. These analyses are confirming the significance analysis discussed 
in chapters 4.2.4, 5.3.5, and 5.3.6. The associated analysis from analysis of 
variance, significance analysis and demonstrated coefficients for RSM 
model responses are aligned with each other, and hence it is inferring the 
validity of the RSM models for further prediction applications. 

125 



6   Development of Mathematical Prediction Models for Solder Profiles 
 

6.3 Prediction Application and Comparison of ANN and 
RSM Models  

After that the validation of both ANN and RSM models are demonstrated, 
the input parameters are used to predict the responses. The MATLAB® 
software is directly calculating the error percentages for ANN models, 
however for RSM models, the error ratio is manually calculated by the 
difference of approximate prediction and the exact values to realize the 
reliability of predicted responses comparing with the experimental 
measures. As illustrated in Figure 53, Figure 54, Figure 55, the error 
variation for each response is highly different. There is no universal 
measure of acceptable error ratio, but it will be defined by the goal setup 
of the study and the space scale of the response. For the basic variables 
and for the measures which are following a linear equation, such as power 
consumption, of course the individual error is quite low. In such cases the 
analysis are followed with an intensive standard deviation analysis and 
analysis of variance. However, for qualitative measures such as void ratio 
which is the product of a dynamic process, there are non-controllable 
influencing parameters on the response. In the discussed statistical 
analysis for void fraction, the ratio of variance and the adjusted R2 is 
proving the reliability of data series and therefore the minimality of 
non-controllable parameters.  

Figure 53 is displaying the void ratio prediction for both models and the 
corresponding errors. The RSM model for void ratio is obtaining a higher 
variation of error occurrence up to 30%. It explains the development of a 
qualitative model in which some influencing factors are unknown or if the 
preceding processes should be investigated to find the influential factors. 
The errors occurred for void ratio, also is corresponding to the 
explanations in the statistical analysis of the input parameters with R2 

value of 81.40%. In comparison, the ANN model is showing much less 
error variation, and therefore the predicted void ratio is following the 
experimental measurement. In contrary with void ratio model, the errors 
shown in Figure 54 and Figure 55, are depicting much less error 
fluctuation, and therefore a higher accuracy of predicted responses. The 
error for RSM model in Figure 55 is revealing an error-trend that is 
occurred by the change of pressure setup, and therefore it shows a lower 
accuracy of predicted measures for the profiles with pressure of 2 bar.

Both well trained ANN and RSM models were compared with their 
predictive capability. The average error for ANN as well as the RSM 
models per each response is tabulated in Table 20. Considerably, the 
average error for void ratio is much higher than for other two responses, 
and the error obtained by the RSM method is much higher comparing to 
ANN approach. The results illustrating that the ANN model has higher 

127 



6   Development of Mathematical Prediction Models for Solder Profiles 
 

modeling ability rather than the RSM models for soldering process. The 
ANN model predictions are corresponding much closer to the line of 
perfect prediction than the RSM models. Thus, the ANN model shows a 
significantly higher generalization capacity than the RSM models.

6.4 Conclusion 

In this chapter, the soldering process is mathematically modeled for 
prediction application and to study the behavior of the profiling system. 
The ANN and RSM methods firstly are employed to build up the models 
for prediction applications, and secondly the results are used for 
comparison purposes to check the reliability of any of these methods for 
the current case study application. It is inferred that: 

 One hidden layer and four hidden neurons are defining the 
topology of the ANN models. The model for this topology is 
used for void ratio, total power consumption and total exergy 
efficiency. These three models after several repetition of 
training are obtaining the best validation performance with 
the MSE of near zero. The regression results (R value) for 
training, validation, test, and the total regression are showing 
accuracy over 95%. The high accuracy of trained model 
associated with low MSE demonstrates the reliability of these 
models for prediction application. 

 The safe operation zones for soldering oven are known, and to 
conduct a comprehensive experimental design, the Full 
Factorial design is used to create the RSM model. The 
associated analysis from analysis of variance, significance 
analysis and demonstrated coefficients for RSM model 
responses are conforming to each other, and hence it is 
inferring the validity of the RSM models for further prediction 
applications. 

128 



6.4   Conclusion 
 
 

 The comparison of average errors for the each model are 
illustrating that the ANN model has higher modeling ability 
rather than the RSM models for soldering process. 

Deduced from the implemented models in this study, the higher 
predictive accuracy of the ANN can be attributed to its universal ability to 
approximate the nonlinearity of the system, whereas the RSM is restricted 
to a second-order polynomial. It is experienced that the generation of 
ANN model requires a large number of iterative calculations and to check 
the overfitting process. Therefore ANN model may require a high 
computational time to create and more costly, whereas it is only a single 
step calculation for a response surface model. Comparing the overall facts 
for the mathematical modeling, ANN is realized as a convincing modeling 
approach for further prediction application in soldering process.

7 Multi-Objective Optimization of the 
Trade-Off Model Using a Decision Making 
Approach for Soldering Process 

In this chapter, a multi-criterion optimization approach is applied first to 
investigate the compromised optimum solution for the experimental 
result, and hence later for the predicted result. The multi-objective 
optimization approach is shown in Figure 56.  As shown in this roadmap, 
the first step is to define the criteria according to the setup framework of 
the decision maker. As known, the void ratio is representing the quality 
factor and the production lead-time for time factor. For the energy factor, 
the power consumption of the oven technology and periphery equipment, 
and the exergy efficiency of utilized resources are elaborated. To calculate 
the cost factor, consumed resources and materials are furtherly 
investigated.

maker is able to achieve the target setup including the boundary of set of 
optimized performances. A vector-based solution is presented to control 
the weight and importance of each criterion for a multi-objective solution 
for the experimental DOE. The trained ANN algorithms will be used for 
prediction applications and to prove the best parameters setups which are 
not experimentally verified. The optimized comprised solutions from 
experiments and predictions are furtherly experimentally verified to prove 
the accuracy of the developed prediction models.  

7.1 Development of Trade-Off Model for the Best Setup 
Parameters of Each Criterion 

The statistical and significance analysis are preparing for an approach to 
rank the strength of accumulative influencing factors on the final 
responses. The measures of effect of these factors on response are 
statistically realized but the decision maker according to the 
multi-objective optimization solution will define the positive or negative 
desire. 

The difficulty of multi-objective or multi-criterion lies in the fact that the 
objectives are in conflict with each other and an improvement of one 
objective may lead to the reduction of other objectives. Therefore, 
obtaining the global optimum in all objectives at the same time is 
impossible. The goal of a multi objective solution is a compromise 
between different objectives in order to get the balance and to achieve 
optimum for every objective as much as possible. There are many 
methods such as multi-objective weighted method, hierarchical 
optimization method, objective programming, and hybrid programming 
method [208]. These methods are obtaining efficient solutions for 
decision makers to reach the objective. Theoretically  most  accepted   
approach  is  to  find  effective  solutions frontier  of  multi-objective 
programming which is called   Pareto   efficient solution set. But in 
general there are infinitely many Pareto optimal solutions which lead to 
the complexity of algorithm and the large amount of calculation. This 
study is using Pareto optimality as a multi-criterion solution to seek a 
trade-off between all objectives. These objectives relating to their 
significance on responses are aimed to be maximized or minimized.  

In chapters 4.2.4, 5.3.6, 5.4.2, the statistical and significance analysis are 
conducted, and the effects of input parameters on responses are 
evaluated. According to these analyses, a criterion definition in trade-off 
model is given in Table 21. For time factor, the waiting time is relevant 

132 



7.1   Development of Trade-Off Model for the Best Setup Parameters of Each Criterion 
 
 

because other factors are not significantly effective on production 
lead-time. The waiting time is highly statistically significant and it should 
be reduced for all criteria. The cost factor is including the cost for the 
resources, energy and the material flow in the process, and it should be 
minimized. The process cost for resources are changing according to 
profile setup. The effect of pressure and waiting time on the periphery 
power consumption, and the temperature and waiting time on the power 
consumption of the oven are statistically highly significant. The effect of 
temperature on final production cost is not statistically significant, but 
other factors are. Furthermore, waiting time is highly statistically 
significant on the process cost, and the optimality criteria tending this 
response to be reduced minimally.  

Respect to criteria definition, the quality factor should be optimally 
maximized as possible. The analysis of variance illustrate that shear test 
results are not valid for further analysis, however the void ratio is 
considered as the profounding indicator for the quality criterion. Pressure 
is demonstrating the biggest significance on void creation, and to achieve 
the minimum ratio, the highest measure of pressure, lower temperature, 
and a shorter waiting time is targeted.

For the energy factor, the widespread target is the 
reduction/minimization of the consumed resources in the production 
process. The total power consumption is representing the electrical 
energy consumption of the oven technology and the periphery 
equipment. All factors are highly significant, and as for the criterion 

133

for Soldering Process 

 

definition, the reduction of temperature and waiting time is reducing the 
electrical energy of the oven and periphery equipment as well as a 
significant reduction for the power consumption of compressors which 
are supplying the nitrogen gas and hence the pressure build-up. The 
pressure and temperature are the main parts of thermomechanical exergy. 
Therefore, for the total exergy efficiency, the pressure interaction, which 
is contributing for more than 80% of the exergy efficiency, should be 
extensively increased; however, the temperature does not prove a 
significant effect. Electrical energy that is 100% exergy, by longer 
production lead-time will be converting more into exergy loss, and hence 
reduction of waiting time increases the total exergy efficiency. 

According to the criterion definition in the trade-off model, Figure 57 
illustrates the Pareto optimality model for all profiles. All the best 
performances are obtained by profiles with the waiting time of 20 
seconds. Some associated profiles are creating the surface plots for a best 
specific performance. Nine profile coordinators are creating the green 
surface plot which is demonstrating the profiles with the lowest cost and 
production lead-time. Among the nine profiles, four profile coordinators 
shown in the corners of the black surface plot is showing the profiles with 
the highest quality and exergy efficiency, and lowest total power 
consumption. It is inferred that at any of these surface plots, any profile 
coordinators in these surface could be associated with a specific best 
performance. All profile coordinates in green surface plot showing the 
minimum production lead-time of 448 seconds and the lowest process 
cost about 0.35 €. Only one profile coordinate is demonstrating the best 
quality and lowest void ratio of 4.54%. One profile coordinate in the 
model is proving the highest exergy efficiency of 28.6%. Four profile 
coordinates in the black surface are showing the profiles for the lowest 
total power consumption of 1.88 kWh, 1.90 kWh, and 1.91 kWh.

7.2 Development of Decision Making Process for the 
Multi-objective Solution 

The lowest costs with the shortest production lead-time solution is best 
suited for mass soldering of high-tech electronic devices, as for the time 
and cost is the most important factor. When a company is producing high 
performance electronics, the highest quality should be the primary 
objective. For green companies, the solution with the highest exergy 
efficiency is suggested. The best profiles for each objective are shown in 
the trade-off model; however no profile is identified which is satisfying a 
multi-objective solution. Therefore, compromised solution-based vector is 
introduced to apply on the trade-off model for a multi-objective decision 
making process.  

The comprised solution is requiring the extreme coordinates/optimized 
solutions per each objective. The extreme coordinates for quality and 
exergy efficiency is determined, and any compromised solution for these 
objectives are satisfying the decision for the lowest cost and production 
lead-time. However, the extreme point for the total power consumption is 
not yet clear. Thereby, by applying the criterion definitions  from Table 21 

135 



7   Multi-Objective Optimization of the Trade-Off Model Using a Decision Making Approach 
for Soldering Process 

 

on the surface plot of power consumption in the trade-off model, the 
setup profile for 250 °C, 2 bar, and 20 seconds is determined as the 
extreme coordinate/optimized solution. Moreover, this profile is realized 
with the best exergy efficiency and better quality comparing with other 
four profiles in the surface plot. The extreme coordinates for three 
objectives are illustrated in red dash-line in Figure 57, and any coordinate 
in the surface boundary of the selected area is partially satisfying all the 
objectives in the trade-off model. To control the measure of importance, a 
weight is given to any of these objectives. The sum of the weights, as 
shown in equation 27, should be one. The parameter settings for the 
compromise solution were calculated utilizing a vector-based equation 
(Eq. 28). With the help of the extreme points of vectors and weights, 
other intermediate solutions can be calculated. Depending on the 
predefined scenario and associated objective, these weights using the 
pairwise comparison are determining the final decision on the setup 
parameters.

To verify the above vector-based equation a compromised intermediate 
(equal importance of given weights) solution for the extreme points of the

𝑤𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 equals 0.33, and 0.33 is defined for 𝑤𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦, and the result are 
experimentally verified in Table 22. 

7.3 Prediction Application and Experimental Result 
Verification for the Trade-Off Model  

The calculated compromised solution from the trade-off performance is 
experimentally verified and the measures are demonstrated as if the 
expectation from each criterion is equal. Moreover than verification 
applications, further experiments are conducted to prove the quality of 
developed models for prediction usage. Form the conclusion in chapter 6, 

136 



7.3   Prediction Application and Experimental Result Verification for the Trade-Off Model 
 
 

it is concluded that the developed ANN model are reliable for prediction 
application, and therefore these models are deployed to investigate the 
optimized compromised solutions.  

First, the input variables out of the boundary of the given input 
parameters in experimental design are defined. Two constraints are 
defining the boundaries of the input variables. The first constraint is the 
technology, material, and technical concerns. If the peak temperature is 
set below the liquidus temperature, the solder material does not melt, and 
if it sets too high, the flux vaporizes too fast. These concerns are 
combined with the constrain criterion in Table 21, and hence a set of 
input variables are designed to predict the responses. Thereby, 250 °C is 
the minimum and the desired temperature, and it is set to be increased 
incrementally by 5 °C up to 300 °C. Zero bar is the minimum and 4.2 bar is 
set as the maximum technical overpressure measure. Likewise, from the 
criterion definition, 10 seconds is proven as the desired measure for the 
waiting time. These measure levels are used as the input variables for 
further prediction applications. The prediction values for cost, quality and 
exergy efficiency were obtained utilizing the ANN models and the 
production lead-time was interpolated utilizing the experimental values. 
1.88 kWh is calculated for the total power consumption of all profiles. In 
addition, it is inferred that the total process cost is decreasing from 0.02 € 
to 0.01 € per 5 seconds decrease of waiting time. However, these changes 
are negligible and it does not identify the predicted profile with the lowest 
cost. The exergy efficiency will be increasing 0.02% if the pressure 
changes from 4 bar to 4.2 bar. The exergy efficiency for most of profiles is 
showing the fluctuations from 27% to 28%. The given parameters for 
265 °C, 4.2 bar and 10 seconds are illustrating the highest predictive 
exergy efficiency of 28.7%. The setup profile of 250 °C, 4.2 bar and 10 
seconds present the lowest void ratio of 4.05%.  

The predicted input variables for the optimized exergy efficiency and 
quality are used for the compromised intermediate solution in 
equation 29. The decision made in this scenario is deploying an equal 
weight; 𝑤𝐸 𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 equals 0.5 and 𝑤𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 equals 0.5. The verified result for 
the comprised intermediate predictive solution is presenting the 
optimized setup parameters, which are addressing 5.4% of void ratio and 
28.6% for exergy efficiency. The verified result is conforming to the 
verified predictive solutions, and it demonstrates the reliability of 
optimization equation model.

profiles of the reflow oven with overpressure chamber. Depending on the 
decision strategy for the chosen weights for quality and exergy efficiency, 
the desired solutions in parallel are satisfying the optimization objectives 
for the lowest production lead-time, lowest cost, and lowest power 
consumption. 

The comprised intermediate predictive solution is presenting the reliable 
solution, which is experimentally proven. By comparing the result from 
this solution with comprised intermediate solution, the optimized 
intermediate solution for all criteria in the trade-off model is explicitly 
perceptible. Further above explained verifications, three profiles from 
predicted performances are experimentally examined as the means of 
comparison to check the effect of waiting time changes with the highest 
possible technical overpressure measure. In these experiments, the void 
ratio is not presenting a higher void fraction when the waiting time is 
increasing. In contrary the exergy efficiency for these profiles are 
rationally high due to the fact that the overpressure is setup at the highest 
possible technical value. The results are summarized and the 
experimental verifications for these profiles are shown in Table 22. 

7.4 Conclusion 

The improvement and optimization of the overpressure reflow soldering 
process is critical in order to achieve high quality and reliable solder 
joints, which in turn increases the yield of the downstream stages of the 
PCB assembly. The reflow soldering process integrated with overpressure 
module furtherly involves multiple performance characteristics including 
resource, cost, and time efficiency, and is nonlinear in nature.  

In this chapter, a compromised intermediate equation model is presented 
which is obtaining a decision-based optimization solution. A vector-based 
compromised solution is requiring the extreme coordinates of the trade-
off model, and by the given weight, the performances for a multi-objective 
solution is controlled. As an example, to obtain the highest quality of 
solder joint with the least void ration for class 3 and high-tech electronic 
devices, the given weight for quality factor will be 1, and in contrary 0 is 
given to other factors in the trade-off model. The optimized comprised 
solutions from experiments and predictions are furtherly experimentally 
examined to prove the accuracy of the developed prediction models. It is 
inferred that: 

139 



7   Multi-Objective Optimization of the Trade-Off Model Using a Decision Making Approach 
for Soldering Process 

 

 According to criterion definition, for reduction of time, cost, 
total power consumption, the widespread target is the 
reduction/minimization of the waiting time, temperature, and 
pressure factors. However, to optimize the total exergy 
efficiency and quality, overpressure should be maximized. 

 After verification of results, the compromised solution based-
vectors is proven as a reliable solution for a multi-objective 
decision making process. 

 The total process cost in the soldering process is decreasing 
from 0.02 € to 0.01 € per 5 seconds decrease of waiting time.  

 The exergy efficiency will be increasing 0.02% if the pressure 
changes from 4 bar to 4.2 bar. The given parameters for 265 °C, 
4.2 bar and 10 seconds are illustrating the highest predictive 
attainable exergy efficiency of 28.7%. 

 The best quality with the lowest void ratio of 4.05% is 
presented by the setup profile of 250 °C, 4.2 bar and 10 
seconds. 10 seconds is the minimum waiting time until the 
first overpressure (TAL) before the first pressure build-up is 
assuring that bigger voids reach the surface. By applying 4.2 
bar, the highest technical overpressure measure, the void grow 
is reaching to minimum rate. 

 Given an equal importance for all factors in the trade-off 
model for the full factorial DOE, the setup profile of 261.6 °C, 
3.32 bar, 20 seconds waiting time is realized as a compromised 
intermediate solution. By including the technical extreme 
points, 257.5 °C, 4.2 bar, 10 seconds are obtaining the 
compromised intermediate solution for the optimized exergy 
efficiency of 28.6% and the void ratio of 5.4%.  

By the given setup information for the full factorial DOE in Table 6, and 
the concluded result for compromised intermediate solution for the 
temperature in first zone of overpressure chamber, the overpressure 
measure, and the waiting time until the first overpressure build-up, Table 
23 is showing the optimized profile for the best compromised 
performance. When it is not possible to eliminate voids, they should be 
minimized by a systematic approach based on controlling the factors 
involved in the generation of voiding and their mitigation. The smaller 
preheating slope and a rather constant soaking temperature (210 °C) drive 
the optimized profile. The  results  show that  a  smaller  void  area  can  

140 



7.4   Conclusion 
 
 

be  achieved  with  shorter  ramp to peak and TAL (10 seconds) as  this  
minimizes  the   vaporization   of  flux   volatiles   during  the  reflow  
stage  of  the  profile.  Therefore,  as expected, for small solder joints, a 
shorter  TAL  and a lower  peak  reflow  temperature  might well  
minimize  the likelihood of  gas being generated by decomposition of flux 
constituents  in voids trapped at non-wetted areas.

By increase of temperature from 250 °C to 257.5 °C, exergy efficiency is 
reaching to a comprised intermediate trade-off with other factors. 4.2 bar 
overpressure build-up is giving the highest chance to the trapped voids in 
the solder joints to escape. 5 seconds is the minimum duration for 
overpressure holding time and waiting time after the first overpressure so 
that to keep the TAL at its minimum at this stage of the process. Hence it 
reduces the production lead-time, cost, and power consumption, and it 
delivers higher exergy efficiency. An important step for the second 
overpressure is that before releasing the pressure, the components are to 
be moved into the second position to ensure a void-free solder 
connection, and 45 seconds is long enough so that the solder joints are 
solidified below the liquidus temperature. 20 seconds is set as the 
minimum waiting time after the second overpressure to deliver the PCB 
into the cooling zone. The designation of this temperature profile can

help the overpressure soldering process to achieve a multi-objective 
optimization of soldering process as specified in the Six Sigma 
management paradigm and continuous improvement program.

8 Summary 

Surface mount technology (SMT) is the primary method used to attach 
electronic components permanently onto the substrate. A crucial 
improvement in quality of connecting technologies is increasing the 
reliability of solder joint and less heat dissipation due to poor 
connectivity. While  a  significant  level  of  voiding  can  be  tolerated  in  
solder  joints  where  electrical  conductivity  is  the  main  requirement, 
voiding  at  any  level   severely   compromises  thermal   conductivity. The 
voids are generally considered to come mainly from the flux medium by 
volatilization of solvents and as the result of reactions with metal oxides, 
and from decomposition of resins and other constituents of the material. 
To avoid the voiding deficiencies and increase the reliability of the solder 
joints, controlling the release process of voids are mandatory. By 
controlling the atmospheric pressure of the solder and reducing the 
surface tension helps the gases trapped in the solder material reaching to 
the surface. The recent advanced soldering technologies are offering the 
solutions to control the pressure between void and environment 
differences by vacuum or overpressure module concepts. Any of these 
technology concepts however are accompanied by advantages and 
disadvantages. The soldering oven technology combined with an 
overpressure module is offering a void-free solder joint solution, however 
the configuration of the mechanism related to the process is not 
comprehensively investigated yet. Furthermore, the offered technology 
concept in the market is inherently energy intensive and a deep study on 
the resource flow into the process is mandatory if the minimization of the 
consumption is required.  

To cope with the above explained complications, a multi-objective 
optimization solution is offered which is based on a multi-criterion trade-
off model for quality, energy, cost and time criterion. The constraints per 
each criterion and the Five-M are explaining the tools which enable the 
conduction of this study. The comprehensive analysis of the soldering 
oven technology obtain the input variables which lead to control the 
heating factors and gradients of the reflow process and therefore the 
delivered solder joint quality and the resource consumption. For the sake 
of cost and time saving, the Design of Experiment (DOE) is separated into 
four steps to realize the most influential setup parameters of the oven 
technology on void creation process. Deducing from the screening 
process,  the waiting time until the first pressure build-up, the 

143 



8   Summary 
 

temperature in the first zone of the over pressure chamber and measure 
of overpressure are realized as the most influential parameters on the 
voiding process. The full factorial DOE is conducted to examine the void-
free soldering process. In parallel, the production lead-time and the 
resource consumption of the oven technology are measured. In order to 
control the resource flow of the oven technology, a transparency model is 
developed which is dividing the resource consumption of the oven and 
the auxiliary equipment in three levels. The resource flow into the oven 
technology is simulated to consider the none value-adding process time 
(e.g. non-predictable waiting time) and the correlated resource 
consumption. This obtains the total electrical energy consumption 
including none value-adding operations.   

The simulation results are showing that 54% of electrical energy is 
consumed by the oven technology and 46% by the periphery levels. The 
periphery level is sharing the electrical energy consumption as for the air 
compressor 56.4%, the nitrogen compressor 43.4%, and the cooling water 
0.19%, whereas the lights and air conditioning are negligible with a share 
under 0.01%. The statistical analysis and fitted models developed for 
electrical energy consumption of technology level and periphery levels 
demonstrate the reliability of the input data, and hence, waiting time is 
realized with the highest significance on these levels.  

The exergy efficiency is calculated as the means of energy Key 
Performance Indicator (KPI) for the resource flow in the soldering 
process. The pressure change is the most influential factor on the physical 
exergy and hence the total exergy efficiency in soldering process until it is 
brought into equilibrium with the environment. The cost analysis for all 
experimental profiles are illustrating that the waiting time factor is 
significantly influencing on the final total costs as well as interacting with 
the power consumptions in the oven and periphery levels. 

After the conduction of measurement, calculation and analysis of 
indicators for quality, resource, time and cost, these criteria are 
mathematically modeled for further prediction and optimization 
application. This study compares the performance of Response Surface 
Method (RSM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodologies with 
their modeling, prediction, and generalization capabilities using the 
experimental data based on the Full Factorial design. The ANN model 
indicates that it is much more robust and accurate in estimating the 
values of dependent variables when compared with the RSM models. The 
structured nature of the RSM is useful to exhibit the factors contributions 

144 



8   Summary 
 
 

from the coefficients in the regression models. This ability is powerful in 
identifying the insignificant main factors and interaction factors or 
insignificant quadratic terms in the model and thereby can reduce the 
complexity of the problem. However, ANN has consistently performed 
better than the RSM in all aspects for each criterion. 

The approach to find the optimal solution for each criterion however is 
possible but a holistic multi-criterion solution is not obtainable. 
According to the significance analysis, a criterion approach is defined for 
the setup parameters to maximize or minimize each objective/criterion. A 
trade-off model is developed that the decision maker is able to achieve the 
setup target including the boundary set of optimized performances. The 
presented vector-based solution controls the weight of all performances 
for a multi-objective solution, and hence it achieves a compromised 
intermediate solution. ANN model is used to predict the responses for the 
input variables which are not experimentally examined. The verified 
results for the predicted and compromised intermediate solutions are 
conforming to the fact that the ANN model is a reliable application 
solution in soldering process. If the quality is addressed as for the highest 
priority, the minimum technical temperature setup of 250 °C, the 
maximum technical pressure setup of 4.2 bar, and the minimum setup 
waiting time of 10 seconds derives the minimum void ratio. According to 
vector based solution, given an equal importance for all factors in the 
trade-off model for the given data from the full factorial DOE, the setup 
profile of 261.6 °C, 3.32 bar, 20 seconds of waiting time is realized as a 
compromised intermediate solution. By including the technical extreme 
points, 257.5 °C, 4.2 bar, 10 seconds are obtaining the compromised 
intermediate solution for the optimized exergy efficiency and 5.4% of void 
ratio for overpressure soldering process. 

The outlook of this work is mainly focusing on two main topics. Void-free 
overpressure soldering process, and the widespread application of the 
developed trade-off model to consider the economic aspects of similar 
void-free soldering technologies. In soldering process, since the wetting of 
solder on a copper substrate is irreversible these voids have to have been 
there since the beginning of the soldering process. They only needed 
enough time to grow to detectable sizes. In addition, it is likely that most 
of the voids remaining after overpressure reflow are those attached to 
non-wetted areas. This raises the question why and where voids do form 
generally, and this requires more investigations on a real-time based 
monitoring of voids creation. Because, all void ratio investigation in this 
study are conducted through a 2D X-ray analysis and hence the volume of 

145 



8   Summary 
 

bubble voids are not calculated. A 3D volume analysis of solder joints 
obtains an accurate forming behavior of voids fraction. 

Klemm et al. [43] [38], have conducted In-Situ X-ray investigation to 
achieve the lowest final pore contents of < 1 % by applying the combined 
soldering profiles with vacuum and overpressure steps in laboratory scale. 
Also, Syed-Khaja  [209] introduced the technology concepts that the 
pressure variation with combination of multiple vacuum and overpressure 
obtains excellent void content with negligible defects and full IMP 
growth. These technologies are delivering paternoster systems, which can 
be installed flexibly according to the profile with the lowest void ratio. 
Such technology concepts are deriving the maximum solder quality, 
however their long thermal process handling illustrate the necessity of 
application of the developed trade-off model to transparent the economic 
aspects for a successful concept introduction to the market.
