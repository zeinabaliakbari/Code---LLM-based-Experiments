It serves as a benchmark for assessing the accuracy of predictions made by these models. A high R-value suggests that the model is effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data, which is essential for reliable predictions. This measure is particularly important in fields where accurate forecasting is critical, such as finance and healthcare.
