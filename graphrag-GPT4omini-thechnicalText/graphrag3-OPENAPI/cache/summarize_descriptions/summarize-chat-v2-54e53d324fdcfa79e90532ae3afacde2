{"result": "Central Composite Design is a statistical technique utilized in the design of experiments, particularly in response surface methodology. This approach incorporates axial points that may extend beyond the region of interest or safe operating limits, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the experimental space. It is specifically designed to estimate a second-order model and requires at least three continuous factors to be effective. By integrating these elements, Central Composite Design facilitates the optimization of processes and the understanding of complex relationships between variables.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
