{"result": "The entity \"R2 VALUE\" refers to a statistical measure that quantifies the proportion of variance in a dependent variable that is explained by one or more independent variables within a regression model. It serves as an indicator of the effectiveness of the regression model in capturing the relationship between the variables. Specifically, the R2 VALUE reflects how well the independent variable or variables account for the variability observed in the dependent variable, providing insight into the model's explanatory power.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
