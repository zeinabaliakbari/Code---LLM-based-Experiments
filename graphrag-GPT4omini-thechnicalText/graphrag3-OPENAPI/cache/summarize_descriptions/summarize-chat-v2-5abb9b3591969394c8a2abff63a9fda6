{"result": "Solder balls are small spherical formations made of solder that can occur during the soldering process. They typically remain after the soldering process due to various factors such as spattering, excessive oxidation, or poor process conditions. These solder balls can arise from high heating gradients and may be found in solder joints. While they are often considered a defect, under certain conditions, the presence of solder balls may be deemed acceptable.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
