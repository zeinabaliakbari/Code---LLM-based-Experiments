{"result": "The entity \"TOTAL ELECTRICAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION\" refers to the overall amount of electrical energy consumed, which is analyzed through various parameters to understand its significance. Additionally, it encompasses the total electrical energy consumed specifically during the soldering process, which is modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This comprehensive view highlights both the general consumption of electrical energy and its specific application in a particular industrial process.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
