{"result": "The entity \"ANN MODELS\" refers to Artificial Neural Network models that are utilized for various predictive applications. These models are specifically designed to forecast values related to cost, quality, and exergy efficiency, as well as void ratio, total power consumption, and total exergy efficiency. The reliability of these models has been verified through the use of Mean Squared Errors (MSEs), ensuring their effectiveness in prediction tasks. Overall, \"ANN MODELS\" serve as a versatile tool in the realm of predictive analytics, demonstrating their capability across multiple domains.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
