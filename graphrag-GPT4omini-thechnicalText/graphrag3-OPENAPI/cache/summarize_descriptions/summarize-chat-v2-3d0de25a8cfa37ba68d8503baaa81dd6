{"result": "The entity \"NEURAL NETWORK\" refers to a computational model that is inspired by the functioning of biological neural networks found in the human brain. This model consists of interconnected neurons that can learn from data, allowing them to process information effectively. The neurons within a neural network work in parallel to perform calculations, enabling the model to handle complex tasks and improve its performance through learning.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
