{"result": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by biological neural networks, particularly the human brain. They are designed to capture complex relationships between variables and to formulate nonlinear cause-and-effect relationships from experimental data. ANNs employ computationally intelligent methods that find applications in a wide range of fields, including but not limited to electronic packaging.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
