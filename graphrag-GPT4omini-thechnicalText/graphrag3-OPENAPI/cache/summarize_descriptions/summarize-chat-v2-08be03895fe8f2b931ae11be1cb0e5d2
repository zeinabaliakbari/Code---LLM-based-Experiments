{"result": "The \"COOLING TOWER\" and the \"CLOSED CIRCUIT COOLER\" are related entities in the context of estimating electrical energy consumption. The closed circuit cooler is identified as a specific type of cooling tower that is utilized for this purpose. Additionally, the power consumption of cooling towers is often estimated by using closed circuit coolers as a point of comparison. Overall, both entities play a significant role in the assessment of energy usage in cooling systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
