This hierarchical structure is taken advantage of by extending \nPlant Simulation with energy aspects. Hereby the key element is the \nenergy module, which is a network consisting of all required elements and \nmatching methods to administrate specific power or resource profiles, to \ncalculate the total resource consumption of the technology and periphery. \nOnce the resource modules have been added to an existing network, all \nrelevant material flow elements, located in the same network, are \nautomatically detected and linked to the tool. Starting the simulation, not \nonly the material flow, but additionally the resource profiles of the linked \nnetwork are protocolled. To fulfill this purpose, observer procedures are \nused which are automatically invoked if changes in the material flow \nsimulation occur. Thus, they allow the calculation of resource data \n\n98 \n\n\n\n5.2   Analysis of the Electrical Energy Consumption \n \n \n\nwithout changing already existing methods as well as for the material flow \nmodel. \n\n \nFigure 40: The simulation process model for the total power consumption \n\nThe event controller is used to start the simulation and to set the speed \nand scheduling. The energy analyzer makes it possible to analyze the \nresource consumption of the individual systems in the model. The \nproduction run and scheduling, as well as breaks, are defined by the shift \ncalendar. The simulation is planned for five weeks, starts on Monday at \n6:00 am and ends on Saturday at 6:00 am\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
