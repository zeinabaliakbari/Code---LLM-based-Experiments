lead-time of a PCB product, when it \nenters and leaves the soldering oven technology. \n\n2.2.5 The 3rd Constraint: Economic Perspective to Evaluate \nthe Cost Criterion \n\nSeveral approaches are reported for the cost analysis in manufacturing \ncompanies. G\u00f6tze, U. [96] defined an economic classification according to \nthe type of goods and consumption as shown in Table 2. Because this \nstudy is focusing on the boundaries during the production lead-time of a \nPCB product, therefore, the analysis are not addressing the non-short-\nterm consumptions, and not the cost for the amortizations, risk costs, \ntaxes, or interest rates.  \n\nTable 2: Classification of cost categories according to type of goods and consumption [96]  \n\nWhen looking at the short-term consumption, only the consumption of \nprocess-related material goods, resources, electrical energy consumption \nare relevant. The cost for personal cost, external services and the cost for \nlegal interest remain unchanged. The change of solder profiles is \nassociated with the variation of production lead-time and therefore it is \ninfluencing further alterations in energy and material consumption cost. \n\n2.2.6 The 4th Constraint: Solder Joint\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
