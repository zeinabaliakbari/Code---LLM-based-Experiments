influencing factors on void development can be divided in the four \ncategories: soldering process, PCB, solder paste and electronic \ncomponents (Figure 5). Diehm et al. [33] investigated the influence of \nthese factors on void creation. Regarding the soldering process it is \nconcluded that the applied soldering technique, the temperature profile, \nthe soldering atmosphere, the soldering temperature, the holding time \nabove the liquidus temperature and the environmental conditions are \ninfluencing the void development. Also, the solder paste alloy \ncomposition, powder quality, powder size, metal content and flux \ncomposition. The substrate material has an influence on void \ndevelopment, as well as the surface metallization, the surface condition, \nand the solder resist and MicroVia2  [35] [36]. \n\n \nFigure 5: Influential factors on voids development [37] \n\nThe homogeneity of the solder joint is crucial for better thermal and \nelectrical performance. Apart from the utilized material, the soldering \nthermal treatment is changing the form of void creation process. In \nsoldering process, voids formed due to poor wetting of the parent \nmaterials or improper outgassing and it impairs the homogeneity and \ndegrade the product service lifetime [16]. Especially in large-area solder \nconnections and power electronics, voids if not outgassed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
