Process \n\nIn this chapter, a multi-criterion optimization approach is applied first to \ninvestigate the compromised optimum solution for the experimental \nresult, and hence later for the predicted result. The multi-objective \noptimization approach is shown in Figure 56.  As shown in this roadmap, \nthe first step is to define the criteria according to the setup framework of \nthe decision maker. As known, the void ratio is representing the quality \nfactor and the production lead-time for time factor. For the energy factor, \nthe power consumption of the oven technology and periphery equipment, \nand the exergy efficiency of utilized resources are elaborated. To calculate \nthe cost factor, consumed resources and materials are furtherly \ninvestigated.  \n\nCost\n\nTime\nEnergy\n\nQuality\n\nTime Quality Energy Cost\n\nCriterion definition for optimization of each criterion in the tetragonal trade-off model \n\nDevelopment of trade-off model for the best setup parameters of each criterion\n\nPareto optimality modeling of multi-criterion trade-off model for experimental result\n\nDevelopment of a decision making process using a compromised solution based-vector\n\nPrediction application using the developed ANN model for each criterion\n\nOptimization of multi-criterion trade-off model for predicted result\n\nVerification of optimized\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
