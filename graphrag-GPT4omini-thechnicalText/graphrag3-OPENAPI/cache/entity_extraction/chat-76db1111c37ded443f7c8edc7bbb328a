requirement for temperature profile with overpressure function in \nreflow zone [188] \n\n60 \n\n\n\n4.1   Mapping of Process Variables and Responses for Solder Profiling With Overpressure \nModule \n\n \n \nAs shown in Figure 24, b), after a short time at peak temperature and \nnatural outgassing of evaporated volatiles , Nitrogen gas (N2) is pumped \nfrom an external intermediate cylinder into the chamber, and pressure is \nbuilt-up to hold and suppress the solder joint against formation of new \nvoids in the solder joint. By instantly releasing the pressure, the recent \nformed voids are outgassed. To freeze the void-free solder joint, the \npressure is built up again and held until the joint is slowly cooled. This is \ndone by the clocked conveyor travers system, which transports the \nproduct to the second convection zone of the hyper pneumatic chamber. \nAt the second position, the joint is simultaneously completely cooled and \nthe pressure is completely released. The nominal temperature in the \nsecond zone is already set to a value below the liquidus temperature of \nsolder alloy, which allows the solder to solidify while under pressure. This \nsqueeze-release process mechanism forces voids to gas out of the solder \nconnections. Then, the PCB is delivered to the cooling zone, where two \nindividual cooling stages use running water and air as a coolant [188] [191].\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
