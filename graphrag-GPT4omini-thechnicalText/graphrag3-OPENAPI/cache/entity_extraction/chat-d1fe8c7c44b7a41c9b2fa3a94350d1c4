In the present approach, the discrete event simulation framework \nPlant Simulation is chosen as the core software due to its modular \nexpansion options. The extension is implemented as a modular library as \nwell as for the energy module. After adding the power module to an \nexisting material flow model, all components can be configured with a \nsetup dialog of the energy module. In order to implement the desired \nenergy simulation, the network oriented modeling of Plant Simulation is \nutilized. In the given context, the term network is defined as the summary \nof several basic elements to a superior object. Using this structure, \ndifferent hierarchical levels of the model network interlinked with the \nresource flow can be simulated.  \n\nAs shown in Figure 40, the oven technology is separated into three zones \nmodules, and each zone is connected with relevant resource module \naccording to transparency model in Figure 34. These modules are \nmodeled as a network or a basic material flow element given by Plant \nSimulation. This hierarchical structure is taken advantage of by extending \nPlant Simulation with energy aspects. Hereby the key element is the \nenergy module, which is a network consisting of all required elements and \nmatching methods to administrate specific power or resource profiles, to \ncalculate the total resource consumption of the technology and periphery. \nOnce the resource modules have been added to an existing network, all \nrelevant material flow elements, located in the same network,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
