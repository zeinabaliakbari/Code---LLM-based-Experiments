\nused resources in the soldering oven technology. \n\n2.2.3 The 1st Constraint: Exergy Efficiency Analysis to \nEvaluate the Energy Criterion \n\nExergy analysis is a tool to realize the minimum energy required doing the \nwork, and this is used as an indicator in the tetrahedron trade-off model. \nIn thermodynamics, exergy is defined as the usable amount of work that \ncan be obtained from a system when it is taken from its current state of \nthermodynamic balance with the environment, which means exergy is the \nusable part of energy. An investigation of the energy and resource \nefficiency is usually performed with a statistical evaluation, however for \ncomplex thermal processes exergy methods are established [71]. Since the \napplication of energy methods only involves the 1st law of \nthermodynamics and therefore ignore the difference between work and \nheat, these methods lack factors such as the application of material \nbalances, energy balances and equilibrium relationships, which are \nrequired to adequately show effectiveness of the system utilizing given \nenergy resources. While energy cannot be destroyed according to the first \nlaw of thermodynamics, exergy can be destroyed. The destroyed part is \ncalled anergy and cannot be converted back into exergy. Exergy method is \nalso driven from the 2nd law of thermodynamics and it is defined as \u201cThe \nmaximum theoretical useful work (shaft work or electrical work)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
