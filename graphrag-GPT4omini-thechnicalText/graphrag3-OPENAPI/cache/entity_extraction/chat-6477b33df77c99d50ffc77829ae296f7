to realize the most influential setup parameters of the oven \ntechnology on void creation process. Deducing from the screening \nprocess,  the waiting time until the first pressure build-up, the \n\n143 \n\n\n\n8   Summary \n \n\ntemperature in the first zone of the over pressure chamber and measure \nof overpressure are realized as the most influential parameters on the \nvoiding process. The full factorial DOE is conducted to examine the void-\nfree soldering process. In parallel, the production lead-time and the \nresource consumption of the oven technology are measured. In order to \ncontrol the resource flow of the oven technology, a transparency model is \ndeveloped which is dividing the resource consumption of the oven and \nthe auxiliary equipment in three levels. The resource flow into the oven \ntechnology is simulated to consider the none value-adding process time \n(e.g. non-predictable waiting time) and the correlated resource \nconsumption. This obtains the total electrical energy consumption \nincluding none value-adding operations.   \n\nThe simulation results are showing that 54% of electrical energy is \nconsumed by the oven technology and 46% by the periphery levels. The \nperiphery level is sharing the electrical energy consumption as for the air \ncompressor 56.4%, the nitrogen compressor 43.4%, and the cooling water \n0.19%, whereas the lights and air conditioning are negligible with a share \nunder\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
