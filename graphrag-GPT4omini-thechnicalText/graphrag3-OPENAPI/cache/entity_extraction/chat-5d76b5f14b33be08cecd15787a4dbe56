\nvariables which can be used to predict response values. Additionally, it \ncan be used to determine the significance of variables and the optimum \nvariable settings to achieve a certain goal. To set up the model, a series of \nDesign of Experiments (DOEs) should be conducted first. The number of \nexperiments in DOE should follow a \ud835\udc5b \u00d7  \ud835\udc58 design matrix, whereby \ud835\udc5b is \nthe number of different factors and \ud835\udc58 is the number of control variables. \nDepending on the desired output, various design types can be used. For \nfirst-order models, the most common designs are 2k factorial, Plackett-\nBurman and simplex designs. Plackett-Burman is a fractional factorial \ndesign based on main effects alone. It is a two level screening design that \nis used to identify significant factors that influence response. Response \nsurface methodology is the follow up of Plackett-Burman or sometimes \ncan be used standalone. It is full factorial design based on main, \ninteraction and quadratic effects. It is three or five level design that is \nused to optimize significant factors identified by Plackett-Burman \nmethod. For second-order models, the most common designs are the 3k \nfactorial (Full Factorial design), Central Composite and the Box-Behnken \ndesigns [180] [181] [182]. These designs are used\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
