As a \nmatter of fact, at the beginning of the 1990s the research has been quite \nactive in this field, whereas a reduction can be seen in the published \n\n36 \n\n\n\n2.3   Computational Intelligence for Process Optimization \n \n \n\nliterature at the turn of the century. Nonetheless, it seems that the range \nof computational methods has been widened in the 21st century as new \nmethods such as support vectors machines, rough sets, decision trees and \ngenetic algorithms have become a part of the research. More than 60% of \nall studies were about application of these methods in inspection of solder \njoints and quality management issues. Shown in Figure 15, multilayer \nperceptron have been the mostly used intelligent method, covering \napproximately 50% of the applications. Applications of self-organizing \nmaps, fuzzy methods and hybrid methods have also been reported but the \nuse of methods other than these has been only marginal. 82% of the \napplications utilize Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (feedforward artificial \nneural network models), if the applications of hybrid methods are \nincluded.
