The \nbigger compressor supplies 1000 liter of compressed air per minute and \nthe smaller one 500 l/min. The volume of the air pressure tank is 500 liter, \nand the compressors are switched on automatically when the pressure in \nthe tank falls below 6 bar, and it goes to standby when the pressure of the \n\n95 \n\n\n\n5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process \n \n\ntank reaches 45 bar. Also, for the nitrogen gas supply of the system, an all-\nin-one nitrogen skid, from Atlas Copco Company [201], is utilized as a \nguideline. The unit has a tank volume of 1000 liter which is filled with 45 \nbar gas pressure. The mass of nitrogen gas input is calculated per number \nand measure of pressure build-up for each profile multiplied by the 240 \nliter capacity of the chamber. The air pressure input that is used for \npneumatic function of the chamber and the mass consumption is \nnegligible. \n\nFigure 38 shows the resource mass consumption per PCB. Because the \nwater flow has a rational dependency on production lead-time, it shows a \nsimilar pattern as the power consumption. The nitrogen gas consumption \nis dependent on the pressure in the overpressure zone; hence it follows \nthe pattern per profile setup. When the cooling water accounts for almost \n90% of the mass consumption, nitrogen represents 9.6\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
