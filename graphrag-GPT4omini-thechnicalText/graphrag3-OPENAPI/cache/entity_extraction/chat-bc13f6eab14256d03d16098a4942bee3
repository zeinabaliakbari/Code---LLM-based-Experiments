The solder joints for \nresistors are might be too small to follow the mechanisms of void \nformation. Most research agrees that voids by themselves are not a \nreliability concern but rather the location of the voids within the \nsolder joint that determines their negative impact, if any, on the \nreliability of the joint. Voids forming at the intermetallic layers \nand interfacial surfaces near the base metals of the component \nmetal can be the stress concentration points for cracking during \naging or shear force test [195]. \n\n\uf0b7 The optical inspection of solder joints demonstrates a constant \nnumber and size of solder balls across the joints of resistors and \nnon on the other electronic components. Solder balls could be \ncaused by a too high heating gradient. However other relevant \ndefects caused by this flaw are not seen, and therefore, solder \npaste residues caused by stencil printing machine should be the \nmain reason. \n\nAn alternative technology for overpressure soldering to target the voids \ncreation below 5% is vacuum vapor phase technology.
