The curve fitting tool is used to interpolate the data by Thin-plate \nspline method. From Figure 32, a), it is inferable that respect to the \nsignificant interaction of temperature and pressure, the void ratio by \nincrease of pressure and decrease of temperature is highly decreasing. \nHowever, the associated technology limit for overpressure chamber (the \nmaximum allowed overpressure setup up to 4 bar), and the limitation for \nthe minimum heat transfer coefficient (the minimum setup temperature \nfor the oven (250 \u00b0C) respect to solder material with melting temperature \nof 217 \u00b0C), does not enable further investigations beyond this setup \nmeasures to investigate more extended interaction of these factors.  \n\nThe pressure of inside void bubble gas is contributed directly by the \nevaporation of flux and associated solvent and it depends on the \ntemperature. The pressure of atmosphere is prohibiting the void to grow, \nand on the other hand, if the temperature of flux is reaching to the \nequilibrium, it stops evaporating and hence the void stops growing. \nTherefore, the void ratio is less at the waiting time of 20 seconds \ncomparing with 60 seconds.
