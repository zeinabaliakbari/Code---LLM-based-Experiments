For instance, in Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting \nmodules effective conduction of heat through the 1st level die attach to the \nsubstrate and then through the 2nd level attach to the heat sink is critical \nto performance so that voiding in the solder joints at both levels must be \nminimized.  Voids in solder joints are the result of bubbles of gas that do \nnot escape before the solder has solidified [10].
