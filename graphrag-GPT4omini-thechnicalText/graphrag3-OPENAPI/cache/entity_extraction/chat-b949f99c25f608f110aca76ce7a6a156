module is offering a void-free solder joint solution, however \nthe configuration of the mechanism related to the process is not \ncomprehensively investigated yet. Furthermore, the offered technology \nconcept in the market is inherently energy intensive and a deep study on \nthe resource flow into the process is mandatory if the minimization of the \nconsumption is required.  \n\nTo cope with the above explained complications, a multi-objective \noptimization solution is offered which is based on a multi-criterion trade-\noff model for quality, energy, cost and time criterion. The constraints per \neach criterion and the Five-M are explaining the tools which enable the \nconduction of this study. The comprehensive analysis of the soldering \noven technology obtain the input variables which lead to control the \nheating factors and gradients of the reflow process and therefore the \ndelivered solder joint quality and the resource consumption. For the sake \nof cost and time saving, the Design of Experiment (DOE) is separated into \nfour steps to realize the most influential setup parameters of the oven \ntechnology on void creation process.
