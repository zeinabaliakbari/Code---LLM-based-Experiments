If voids are produced \ndue to improper outgassing process of solvent, then the size of a void that \ncan reach and the ease with which it can break through the surface of the \nsolder and escape is affected by the surface tension of the solder. A lower \nsurface tension of the molten solder is obtaining a larger void, and more \nlikely a higher chance to intersect the solder surface and release of \nentrapped bubble.  \n\nBy considering the void mitigation through elimination of solvents from \nthe formulation of the solder paste ingredients, either flux should be not \nbegin to volatile or decompose to create gas until late in the reflow \nprofile. Therefore, the solvent should be completely evaporated in the \npreheating or just before the reflow phase.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
