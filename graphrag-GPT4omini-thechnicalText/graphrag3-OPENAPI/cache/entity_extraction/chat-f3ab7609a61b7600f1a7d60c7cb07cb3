The bubble creates an additional surface in the solder, which \nmeans that the free energy of the system is higher than it would be if the \ngas had escaped. The extra free energy provides a driving force for larger \nbubbles which have a smaller surface area to-volume ratio, to grow at the \nexpense of smaller bubbles.

Faster growth can \noccur by coalescence if the bubbles are being moved by other forces so \nthat they come into contact with other bubbles. In such a contact the \nmicro voids will be absorbed into the macro voids with a net reduction in \nthe area of the gas/solder interface.
