Intelligent Process Optimization Methods for Soldering \nProcess in High-Volume Electronics Production  \n\nSince last years, there have been many studies carried out on the \nmonitoring of reflow soldering process and improvement of soldering \nprocess quality. Most of these studies have adopted qualitative defect \nmechanism analysis and computational simulation models for upgrading \nthe soldering quality through keeping the actual profile at the specified \ntarget level [24]. Three commonly used methods have been implemented \nto achieve this objective [119]:  \n\n\uf0b7 Thermal simulation modeling: a computational model with \nprocess specifications is used to simulate the shape of the reflow \nthermal profile. The simulation is performed iteratively until the \nresults agree with the predefined specifications or the shape of the \ntarget thermal profile. The final recipe(s) will be used as the oven \nmachine setup [26] [120] [121]. \n\n\uf0b7 SPC method: the ingredients of a reflow thermal profile (e.g. setup \npeak temperature, soaking temperature, preheating slope, and so \non) are monitored by traditional control charts with predefined \nlimits to diagnose and identify any variability in the reflow \nsoldering process and reduce the need for post-reflow inspections \n[122]. \n\n\uf0b7 Computational intelligence approach: the computational \nintelligence approaches are designated to acquire knowledge of \nthe essential factors that influence the performance of the reflow \nsoldering process\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
