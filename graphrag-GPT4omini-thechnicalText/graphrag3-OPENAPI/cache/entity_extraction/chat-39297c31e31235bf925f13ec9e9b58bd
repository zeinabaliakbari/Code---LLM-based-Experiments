Both technical solutions and methodology are \ndeveloped to reduce energy consumption in production processes [60]. \n\nThe premier requirement of energy efficiency in manufacturing is to apply \nmethods to transparent the energy consumption along the manufacturing \nchain. An important part of reducing the energy demand is to effectively \nmeasure, calculate, and evaluate the efficiency of production flow in order \nto realize the optimization potentials. The DIN EN ISO 9000:2005 defines \nefficiency as follows: \"the relationship between the result achieved and \nthe resources used.\" Following this standard definition, energy efficiency \nrepresents the ratio of consumed energy (e.g. kWh) to the generated \n\n22 \n\n\n\n2.2   Classical Project Management Trade-Off Model as a Multi-Objective Optimization and \nDecision Making Method \n\n \n \nbenefits (e.g. units produced or value). It corresponds to the productivity \nthat describes the ratio of produced goods (output) to the consumed \nproduction resources (inputs) [6]. Another possibility for the definition of \nenergy efficiency in manufacturing is the ratio of the real productivity to \nthe ideal productivity. Here, the question is answered of how the actual \nproduced goods (e.g. the amount) correspond with the defined energy \ninput, i.e. the possible number under ideal conditions [61]. \n\nSeveral strategies are deployed to transparent and control the energy flow \nof manufacturing processes.
