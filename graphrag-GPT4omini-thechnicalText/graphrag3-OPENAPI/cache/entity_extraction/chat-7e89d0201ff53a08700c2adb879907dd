In these experiments, the void \nratio is not presenting a higher void fraction when the waiting time is \nincreasing. In contrary the exergy efficiency for these profiles are \nrationally high due to the fact that the overpressure is setup at the highest \npossible technical value. The results are summarized and the \nexperimental verifications for these profiles are shown in Table 22. \n\n7.4 Conclusion \n\nThe improvement and optimization of the overpressure reflow soldering \nprocess is critical in order to achieve high quality and reliable solder \njoints, which in turn increases the yield of the downstream stages of the \nPCB assembly. The reflow soldering process integrated with overpressure \nmodule furtherly involves multiple performance characteristics including \nresource, cost, and time efficiency, and is nonlinear in nature.  \n\nIn this chapter, a compromised intermediate equation model is presented \nwhich is obtaining a decision-based optimization solution. A vector-based \ncompromised solution is requiring the extreme coordinates of the trade-\noff model, and by the given weight, the performances for a multi-objective \nsolution is controlled. As an example, to obtain the highest quality of \nsolder joint with the least void ration for class 3 and high-tech electronic \ndevices, the given weight for quality factor will be 1, and in contrary 0 is \ngiven to other factors in the trade-off model.
