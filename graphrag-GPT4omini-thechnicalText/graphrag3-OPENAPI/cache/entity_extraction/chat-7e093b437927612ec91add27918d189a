manufacturing is the ratio of the real productivity to \nthe ideal productivity. Here, the question is answered of how the actual \nproduced goods (e.g. the amount) correspond with the defined energy \ninput, i.e. the possible number under ideal conditions [61]. \n\nSeveral strategies are deployed to transparent and control the energy flow \nof manufacturing processes. As an example in a broader perspective for \nManufacturing Execution System (MES) [62], a strategy is developed in \nwhich each process is segmented into specific manufacturing operations \nwith a specific energy consumption which is so-called EnergyBlocks [63].  \nAs shown in Figure 10, the energy profile of every manufacturing machine, \nsuch as the machining center or transport system, is considered as input \ndata for a defined segment.  \n\n \nFigure 10: Energy consumption in manufacturing chain blocks [63] \n\nTo identify the energy saving potentials, the optimization of the \nmanufacturing sequences are necessary. The key factors to achieve \naccurate EnergyBlocks data are the data sources and the information flow \nof the energy profile of every manufacturing machine. The collection, \nvisualization [64] and analysis of the data either could be conducted by \nmodeling and simulation [54] [65], or by mathematical modeling [63]. \nSuch approaches are designed to assist engineers for planning and \nscheduling handling or assembly processes in order to optimize their \nenergy consumption. \n\n23 \n\n\n\n2   State-of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
