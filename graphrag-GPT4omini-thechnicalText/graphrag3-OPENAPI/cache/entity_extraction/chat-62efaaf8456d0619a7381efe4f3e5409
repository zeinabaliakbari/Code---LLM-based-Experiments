\nand hence, a cooling system with a similar cooling capacity is considered \nto calculate the average power consumption of this periphery. A closed \ncircuit cooler, MCC-MCE A1/A4 cooling tower [200], from Mita Company, \nis considered to estimate the electrical energy consumption value. To \ninvestigate the utilized cooling water entering into the oven, an ultrasonic \nflow meter is used to measures the velocity of input volume. Using \nultrasonic transducers, the flow meter can measure the average velocity of \ncooling water along the path of an emitted beam of ultrasound, by \naveraging the difference in measured transit-time between the pulses of \nultrasound propagating into and against the direction of the water flow. \nThe measured flow rate supply of cooling water is about 1.15 m\u00b3/h. \n\nThe compressed air supply of the oven is controlled centrally. The \ncompressed air system consists of two compressors and two dryers. The \nbigger compressor supplies 1000 liter of compressed air per minute and \nthe smaller one 500 l/min. The volume of the air pressure tank is 500 liter, \nand the compressors are switched on automatically when the pressure in \nthe tank falls below 6 bar, and it goes to standby when the pressure of the \n\n95 \n\n\n\n5   Controlling Procedure for Resource Consumption of Soldering Process \n \n\ntank reaches 45 bar.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
