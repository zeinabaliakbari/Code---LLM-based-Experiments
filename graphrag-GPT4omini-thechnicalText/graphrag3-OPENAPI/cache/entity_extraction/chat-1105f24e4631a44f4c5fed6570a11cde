Defects in Electronics Production \n\nSolder joint quality is extremely important in order to assure the \nreliability of electronic products in the electronics assembly [20] [21]. The \nreflow soldering process is recognized as one of the major sources of \nsoldering defects [14].

The \nhomogeneity and the efficiency of the heat transport have strong \ninfluence on the solder joints, because an inhomogeneous temperature \nprofile can cause reflow soldering failures [18] [22].
