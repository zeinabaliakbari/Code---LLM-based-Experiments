It cannot be conclude that the data do not follow a \nnormal distribution. \n\nA residual versus fitted values plot is used to check if the variances of the \nerror terms are constant and they must have a mean of zero. If this is not \nthe case, your model may not be valid. To check these assumptions, as \nshown in Figure 29, the points on the plot appear to be randomly \nscattered around zero, so assuming that the error terms have a mean of \nzero is reasonable. The vertical width of the scatter does not appear to \nincrease or decrease across the fitted values, so we can assume that the \nvariance in the error terms is constant, and the model is reliable. \n\nMean: 17.55\nStDev: 5.249 \nN: 27  \nAD: 0.499\nP-value: 0.192\n\n \nFigure 29: Residual plots for void ratio (%) \n\nA histogram is most effective when there are approximately 20 or more \ndata points.
