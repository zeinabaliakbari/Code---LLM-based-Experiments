neuron. As the rule of thumb, the number of hidden layers \nshould be somewhere between the number of input and output layer, and \nin most problems one hidden layer is optimal. The number of neurons for \nthe hidden layer also should not exceed twice the number of input nodes; \notherwise an overfitting will be experienced at this point. However, these \nrules are not universal and a set of trial and error tries are revealing the \nbest models with the least occurred error. For all models, Conjugate \nGradient Backpropagation (CGB) with powell-beale restarts algorithm is \nselected as training function and Gradient Descent with Momentum \n(GDM) weight and bias learning function with default Momentum \nconstant of 0.9 and Learning rate of 0.01. \n\nThe MATLAB\u00ae software package is utilized to develop the ANN \narchitecture and model. The neural network toolbox is used to set up and \nfind the best training dataset. The input data and response are defined. \nThe given data for 27 experiments were randomly separated into three \ngroups; 70% for training the data, 15% for testing samples, and 15% for \nvalidation. A final ANN topology for the hidden layers and neurons and \nan output layer with the Sigmoid transfer function is designated to train \nand test the experimental data with a limit of 10,000 epochs for all \nmodels.
