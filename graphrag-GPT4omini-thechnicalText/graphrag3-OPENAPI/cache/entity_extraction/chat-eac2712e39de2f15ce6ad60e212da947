It is typical for the \nproduction of electronics that practically the only operation using the \nhistorical process data is the Statistical Process Control (SPC) [102] [103] \n[104], whereas the proactive operations for process improvement, such as \ndiagnostics and optimization [19] [105] [106], often lack this valuable and \nabundant information. In other words, process equipment is regularly \nused in the production without a thorough analysis of the data that is, or \nat least could be, stored during the process. Due to the increasing amount \nof data and technical advances in information technology and computer \nsystems, the process experts need also new and better instruments for \nprocess analysis and modeling. The key, in this respect, are automated \ndiagnostics and optimization systems that enable fast and easy access to \nprocess data [107]. \n\nTo enable a systematic analysis approach, a broad range of computational \nmethods is used to analyze and improve processes. The used models vary \nfrom simple regression models to complex advanced models. The simple \nmethods are used for analysis, as they are fast and easy to understand and \nimplement. The complex methods are used for difficult optimization \nproblems. If there is only a single optimization objective, the variable is \nfocused. Multi-objective optimization on the other hand do not result in \nunique optimal solutions, but in optimum ranges for the used variables, \nthe so-called Pareto\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
