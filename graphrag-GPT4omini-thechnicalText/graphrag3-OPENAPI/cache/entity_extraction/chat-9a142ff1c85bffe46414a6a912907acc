al. [171] created a \npredictive model for the sheer force of reflow soldered joints of ball grid \narray packages. Their system was based on integrated use of a multilayer \nfeed forward neural network for modeling and sequential quadratic \nprogramming for optimization. Zhou et al. [172] combined a back \npropagating ANN with particle swarm optimization to optimize \nthermomechanical fatigue reliability of solder joints in Plastic Ball Grid \nArray (PBGA).  Liukkonen et al. [173] [174] exploited several investigations \nto test multiple linear regression and multilayer perceptron neural \nnetwork to the variable selection in the wave soldering process profiles. \nThey also proposed a model for variable selection of wave soldering \nprocess by using the overall cost of poor soldering quality as the model \noutput. These systems can offer an advantageous automated tool for a \nquality engineer working for predictive quality management. \nAlternatively, the process engineers can exploit the system to process \noptimization in various manufacturing processes. Also, for the \noptimization of reflow soldering processes, BP algorithm is proposed to \npredict [175] and improve the optimum soldering temperature profile \n[176] [177], to improve the online control and Automatic Process Control \n(APC) [178], and to diagnose the technology setup parameters and \npredicting the output elements of a reflow temperature profile [119\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
