Central Composite designs usually have axial \npoints that may not be in the region of interest, or may be impossible to \nconduct because they are beyond safe operating limits. The Box-Behnken \ndesign is identifying all design points fall within the safe operating zone. \nIn comparison with the two above, the third solution, the Full Factorial \ndesign is the most useful and powerful in explorations of the factor space \nto identify the region of optimal response because it is considering every \ncombination of factor levels.

This study deployed the Full Factorial design to create and \nanalyze the response surface. \n\nMinitab\u00ae software is utilized to conduct the RSM. After identifying the \ndesigns for which the experimental data should be analyzed, the \ncontinuous factors (input process parameters), categorical factors \n(categorical classification of data), as well as the responses are defined. \nThe RSM is producing a mathematical model, which correlate the input \nparameters and responses according to a polynomial equation.
