In this study, the stencil printing was done with \naluminum blade squeegee with 45\u00b0 angle, stencil thickness of 110 \u03bcm, \nprint force of 4.0 kg and 35 mm/sec print velocity. In the next step, the \nelectronic components were placed by a SIPLACE SX2 (ASM Assembly \nSystems GmbH & Co. KG, Munich) placement machine. It has a \ntheoretical placement rate of 67,750 components per hour at a placement \naccuracy of \u00b1 22 \u03bcm, \u00b1 0.05\u00b0/(3sec). In the third step, the substrate-\nmounted components will be sent to the soldering oven. Figure 21 shows \nthe reflow oven used in this study, which is manufactured by Seho \nSystems GmbH (SEHO Systems GmbH, Kreuzwertheim). This oven is \nequipped with an overpressure chamber module in the peak zone with a \ntotal volume of 240 liter, and it is designed to build the overpressure up to \nmaximum standard of 4.2 bar using compressed air or nitrogen. For the \nproper transport of PCBs during the soldering process in the oven a metal \ncarrier frame is used which is ensuring a safe delivery of substrate from \nthe preheating zone to overpressure module and along the entire process. \n\n52 \n\n\n\n3.3   Material\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
