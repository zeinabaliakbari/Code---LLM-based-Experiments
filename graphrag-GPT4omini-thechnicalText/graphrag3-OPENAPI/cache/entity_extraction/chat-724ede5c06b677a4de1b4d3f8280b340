\ncalculated per production lead-time. To calculate the electrical energy \nutilized by periphery auxiliaries, first the resource mass consumption \nratio per PCB should be calculated and the respective dynamic electrical \nenergy consumption by the equipment is obtained through the simulation \nmodel in the next chapter. \n\nTwo ceiling lamp panels illuminate the oven; each consists of 6 \nfluorescent tubes with 49 watt output. These are switched-on during the \nentire production process simulation. The consumption of air \nconditioning system is depending on the season to automatically regulate \nthe standard temperature in the production hall. Because the air \nconditioning system is only available for the entire building, therefore a \ntool is used to calculate the power consumption per volume of the used \nspace by the oven [199]. The water is used as a cooling medium to cool \ndown the cooling zone and it is supplied via a cooling tower on the roof of \nthe building. The power consumption of the cooling tower is not clear, \nand hence, a cooling system with a similar cooling capacity is considered \nto calculate the average power consumption of this periphery. A closed \ncircuit cooler, MCC-MCE A1/A4 cooling tower [200], from Mita Company, \nis considered to estimate the electrical energy consumption value. To \ninvestigate the utilized cooling water entering into the oven, an ultrasonic \nflow meter is used to measures the velocity of input volume\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
