predicted responses comparing with the experimental \nmeasures. As illustrated in Figure 53, Figure 54, Figure 55, the error \nvariation for each response is highly different. There is no universal \nmeasure of acceptable error ratio, but it will be defined by the goal setup \nof the study and the space scale of the response. For the basic variables \nand for the measures which are following a linear equation, such as power \nconsumption, of course the individual error is quite low. In such cases the \nanalysis are followed with an intensive standard deviation analysis and \nanalysis of variance. However, for qualitative measures such as void ratio \nwhich is the product of a dynamic process, there are non-controllable \ninfluencing parameters on the response. In the discussed statistical \nanalysis for void fraction, the ratio of variance and the adjusted R2 is \nproving the reliability of data series and therefore the minimality of \nnon-controllable parameters.  \n\nFigure 53 is displaying the void ratio prediction for both models and the \ncorresponding errors. The RSM model for void ratio is obtaining a higher \nvariation of error occurrence up to 30%. It explains the development of a \nqualitative model in which some influencing factors are unknown or if the \npreceding processes should be investigated to find the influential factors. \nThe errors occurred for void ratio, also is corresponding to the \nexplanations in the statistical\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
