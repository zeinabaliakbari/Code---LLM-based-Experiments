In such a contact the \nmicro voids will be absorbed into the macro voids with a net reduction in \nthe area of the gas/solder interface. In reflowing solder paste there is \nsufficient movement for that to occur so that voiding in solder joints \ntypically occurs as a relatively small number of larger voids [10]. Because \nof the ambition of gas bubbles and liquid enclosures to minimize their \nsurface, the voids will contract in the solder gap depending on the size. \nBecause the distribution of voids in the solder gap is rarely uniform and \n\n14 \n\n\n\n2.1   Soldering Process Technology and the Mechanisms \n \n \n\nmicro voids can cumulate to larger voids, a tilting of component is the \nresult as a rule. A high tilt intensifies inevitably the inhomogeneity, the \nnon-uniform distribution of currents and temperature and the \nthermomechanical stress [33]. \n\nBy introduction of lead-free solders with the well-known difficulties of \npoor wetting and smaller process windows the outgassing process of voids \nhas become more acute. Through wetting balance analysis, a faster \nwetting and shorter profiles at 10% above the melting point of solder alloy \ncontribute to reduce voids and increase the chance of bubbles leaving the \nsolder joint [33].
