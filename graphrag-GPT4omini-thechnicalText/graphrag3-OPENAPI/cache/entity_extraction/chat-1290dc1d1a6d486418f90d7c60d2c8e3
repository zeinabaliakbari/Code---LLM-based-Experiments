The \nperiphery level is sharing the electrical energy consumption as for the air \ncompressor 56.4%, the nitrogen compressor 43.4%, and the cooling water \n0.19%, whereas the lights and air conditioning are negligible with a share \nunder 0.01%. The statistical analysis and fitted models developed for \nelectrical energy consumption of technology level and periphery levels \ndemonstrate the reliability of the input data, and hence, waiting time is \nrealized with the highest significance on these levels.  \n\nThe exergy efficiency is calculated as the means of energy Key \nPerformance Indicator (KPI) for the resource flow in the soldering \nprocess. The pressure change is the most influential factor on the physical \nexergy and hence the total exergy efficiency in soldering process until it is \nbrought into equilibrium with the environment. The cost analysis for all \nexperimental profiles are illustrating that the waiting time factor is \nsignificantly influencing on the final total costs as well as interacting with \nthe power consumptions in the oven and periphery levels. \n\nAfter the conduction of measurement, calculation and analysis of \nindicators for quality, resource, time and cost, these criteria are \nmathematically modeled for further prediction and optimization\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
