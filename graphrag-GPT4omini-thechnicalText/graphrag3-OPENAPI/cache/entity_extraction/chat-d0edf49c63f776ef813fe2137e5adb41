Optimization Solutions \n \n\nTherefore, commonly the destructive tests such as shear force test are \nconducted to study the connection of the size and position of voids with \nthe reliability of the solder joint. \n\nVoids in the solder joints are nearly inevitable for common reflow \nsoldering process conditions. As shown in Figure 6, after the placement \nprocess of electronic component, the solder material in the reflow oven is \nstarting to melt. First, the solvent material is starting to evaporate, the \nsmaller voids are forming larger voids. If the solder paste is melting \nsooner than the alloy of the solder balls, the evaporating flux has a chance \nto escape from solder gap before the balls are melting. Hence, less gases \nand residues will be enclosed in the solder joints in this case [33]. \nTherefore, the ingredients of the solder pastes, the evaporation \ntemperature of solvent, which are evaporating during the soldering \nprocess, affect the final amount of enclosure gases.  \n\n \nFigure 6: Soldering process from left to right: a. after placement, b. solving agent starts to \nevaporate, c. solving agent is vaporized, d. gas production after melting of solder [38] \n\nThe gas created in molten solder is in a thermodynamically unstable \nsituation.
