Thus, it is \na key to identify what brings value to the customer, and focus on these \nactivities connected to the production of the product or the features the \ncustomer is willing to pay for. All other activities are considered as non-\nvalue adding steps and referred to as waste. The lean concept reveals \nbottlenecks, unnecessary activities and optimization potential in order to \nreduce waste and improve lead-time of production [66]. Hence, \nquantitatively measuring performance to enable accurate and detailed \nanalyses is essential when it comes to manage the lean Continuous \nImprovement Process (CIP) [67].  \n\nKPIs are crucial performance parameters that represent a specific value \nover a defined period, and they simply track the values of interest and can \nbe reported in order to show, for instance, deviations above a certain \nnorm [67]. Likewise, for resource efficiency, benchmarking, and energy \nKPIs in general, is a promising method of comparison that searches for \nsolutions among the strongest competitors and can be used in almost \nevery production unit. KPIs can be used for a comparison of resource \nefficiency, however, only from specific perspectives. As shown in Figure 11 \nfor the operation processes, the measures should be identified which \nillustrate the value-added energy into a specific process.
