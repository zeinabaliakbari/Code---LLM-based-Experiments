The whole system is perceived \nas parallel because many neurons can implement calculations \nsimultaneously. The most important feature of a neural network is the \nstructure of the connected neurons because it determines the way the \ncalculations are performed. Apart from the source layer that receives the \ninputs and the output layer on which the input layer is mapped, a neural \nnetwork can have one or more intermediate hidden layers. Furthermore, \nthe types of interneuron connections determine the characteristics of a \nnetwork and consequently the tasks for which it is designed to be used. \n\nIn feed forward networks, data run exclusively from the input units to the \noutput units while in recurrent networks, feedback connections act \nbeneficially for the training process and the behavior of the network. \nFinally, the algorithm used for the network training affects its \nperformance and effectiveness. The training of neural networks refers to \nthe procedure adopted to achieve a desired behavior by modifying the \nsynaptic weights, which allows them to learn from their environment and \nimprove their performance through time.
