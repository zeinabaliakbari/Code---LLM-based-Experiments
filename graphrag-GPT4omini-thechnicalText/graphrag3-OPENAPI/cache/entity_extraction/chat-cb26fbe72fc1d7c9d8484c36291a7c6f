dependent on multiple internal and external \nfactors that are classically divided in three categories, which are related to \neach other: time, costs and quality. The classical management approach to \nimprove manufacturing performance is also built on the time-cost-quality \ntrade-off theory. Those important factors are constantly controlled and \nevaluated. For time, the production lead-time is measured. For costs, the \nresource consumption and process dependent cost are considered. For \nquality, the first pass yield and the delivery quality can be measured. \nHowever with the rising importance of energy and resource consumption, \nthe trade-off model was expanded by the factor energy and resource \nconsumption in the frame of green controlling [1]. \n\nThe desire to produce energy and resource efficiently began to grow \ncaused not only by the rising energy expenses and by the increasing \nenvironmental awareness, but also through the legislations in energy \npolicy by the German government. The electricity supply from renewable \nenergy sources is regulated nationwide by the German law for \ndevelopment of renewable energies. The main driver of this development \nis the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000, which aims to \nachieve an 80% share of renewable energies in the electricity mix by 2050. \nRenewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaic are \ndependent on weather and daytime. While coal-fired and nuclear power \nplants produce electricity constantly, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
