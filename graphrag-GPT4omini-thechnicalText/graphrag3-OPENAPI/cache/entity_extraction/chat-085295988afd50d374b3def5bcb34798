regulated nationwide by the German law for \ndevelopment of renewable energies. The main driver of this development \nis the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000, which aims to \nachieve an 80% share of renewable energies in the electricity mix by 2050. \nRenewable energy sources like wind power and photovoltaic are \ndependent on weather and daytime. While coal-fired and nuclear power \nplants produce electricity constantly, the supply from renewable energy \nsources is rather unstable. With its rising share, the electricity supply \nchanges. To adapt to these changes, an adjustment in consumer behavior \nis necessary to ensure the stability of the electricity supply [2] [3] [4]. \nBeyond the legislations perspective, the annual greenhouse gas emissions \nshall be reduced by 80% up to 95% until 2050 in comparison to 1990 and \nGermany will refrain from using nuclear power [5]. \n\nFor these reasons, the pressure on manufacturing companies for a \nresource efficient setup began to grow in recent years. Unlike the other \nfactors in management trade-off performance, energy factor is difficult to \nmeasure. To determine the energy efficiency of processes, performance \nkey indicators were developed for manufacturing processes with discrete \nproduction [6], as well as for energy-intensive industries with continuous \nproduction [7]. The exergy method is the most popular which is mostly \nused to investigate the complex thermodynamic processes\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
