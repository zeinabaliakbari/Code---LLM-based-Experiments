With its \nclustering ability, data mining can be performed. Additionally, ANNs can \nbe used to approximate functions. Another application of ANNs is the \nprediction ability that is used for the purpose of this work. \n\nApplication of ANN method in soldering process has been mainly \ninvestigated for: (1) quality control and inspection of solder joints and, (2) \nquality management for analyzing, predicting and optimizing the \nsoldering process profile [109]. Intelligent detection and diagnose of faulty \nsolder joints is an important part of electronics production, because any \nflaws cause failures impeding the correct functioning of electronic \nproducts.

Particularly \nmultilayer perceptrons with backpropagation have been a popular \nmethod for inspection [156] [157] [158] [159] and classification of solder \njoints [160] [161]. Nevertheless, there are also applications based on self-\norganizing maps and vector-based learning [162] [163], fuzzy logic  [164] \n[165], genetic algorithms [160] [119], and hybrid intelligence [13] [159].  \n\nQuality management has been the main application field of intelligent \nmethods with regard to mass soldering process of electronics assembly. \nKusiak et al.
