out of solder, which remain after the soldering \nprocess. They can be caused by numerous reasons like spattering, \nexcessive oxidation or poor process conditions causing gassing from the \nflux. Solder balls are acceptable, if they are embedded, encapsulated, fixed \nor do not violate the minimum electrical isolation distance. Despite the \nmajority of solder balls is not caused during the soldering process, a slow \nheating in preheating zone helps to avoid them [23] [31]. \n\nSolder bridges \n\nSolder bridges occur when the solder is not able to separate from two or \nmore electrical connections. After the solidification, the unwanted \nconnection might cause short circuits. To avoid solder bridges, a low \nheating rate is recommended [18] [23].  \n\nVoids \n\nVoids are small inclusions of gas or fluid in the solder joint. If the voids \nare big enough or placed in an unfavorable order, they decrease the \nmechanical strength of the solder joint. Additionally, voids change the \nthermal and electrical properties of the solder joint. Voids should be \ninvestigated by X-ray technology and it is very difficult to avoid them \ncompletely. According to IPC-A-610D, a void ratio of 30% or less is \nacceptable and a higher fraction is considered as defect. IPC-A-610D is \nalso class\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
