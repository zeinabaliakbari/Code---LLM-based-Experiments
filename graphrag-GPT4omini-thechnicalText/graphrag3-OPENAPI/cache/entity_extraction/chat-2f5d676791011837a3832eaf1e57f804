Multi-objective Solution \n \n \n\n \nFigure 57: Trade-off model for the best extreme points of experimental design \n\n7.2 Development of Decision Making Process for the \nMulti-objective Solution \n\nThe lowest costs with the shortest production lead-time solution is best \nsuited for mass soldering of high-tech electronic devices, as for the time \nand cost is the most important factor. When a company is producing high \nperformance electronics, the highest quality should be the primary \nobjective. For green companies, the solution with the highest exergy \nefficiency is suggested. The best profiles for each objective are shown in \nthe trade-off model; however no profile is identified which is satisfying a \nmulti-objective solution. Therefore, compromised solution-based vector is \nintroduced to apply on the trade-off model for a multi-objective decision \nmaking process.  \n\nThe comprised solution is requiring the extreme coordinates/optimized \nsolutions per each objective. The extreme coordinates for quality and \nexergy efficiency is determined, and any compromised solution for these \nobjectives are satisfying the decision for the lowest cost and production \nlead-time. However, the extreme point for the total power consumption is \nnot yet clear.
