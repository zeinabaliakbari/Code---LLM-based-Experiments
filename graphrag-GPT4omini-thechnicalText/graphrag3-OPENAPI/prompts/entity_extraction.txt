-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Entity_types: [resource, machine, material, method, measurement]
Text:
'The periphery auxiliary equipment is consuming electrical energy to supply the demanded resources by the oven. The accumulation of auxiliary power consumption for the oven technology is obtaining the total power consumption of the system. 
The total power consumption is correlated to production lead-time per product. Hence, by mapping the resource flow into the oven, the corresponding electrical energy consumption of the supply systems in the periphery levels are investigated, 
and the analysis is followed by the cost calculation per PCB.'

Text:
The molten solder is isolated within the network of primary tin dendrites and therefore the solidification and reduction of the volume delivers accommodated voids. Voids created in this process are obtained irregular shape that reflects
 the shape of the solidification front that formed them. If the reduction of volume is extreme, the shrinkage of the voids could intersect the surface of the solder joint which appears as crack cavity or shrink hole."

Example 3:

Text:
The main difference between laminography and tomography is that in the former one the rotation axis of the sample is not perpendicular to the x-ray beam and the algorithm is developed for imaging regions 
of interest (ROI) in flat, especially.
Before the start of the accelerated EM tests, the solder joints were scanned for initial imaging in 3D as reference. 
After a given hours of EM stressing, the samples were re-scanned to check the changes inside
