tell me about overpressure soldering process ," The request asks for information about a specific technique used in soldering, which is referred to as ""overpressure soldering."" This method involves applying pressure while heating the solder, which is typically done to ensure good wetting and improve joint strength. To create a more generic question that encompasses this concept, you might ask: **What are the key elements involved in enhanced soldering techniques that use pressure during the process?","4   Quality Investigation for Overpressure Soldering Process through Design of Experiments

84 of experimental design followed by statis tical analysis shows the vital 
parameters influencing a void -free soldering process and hence the 
significance of effect.  
From this chapter, the following conclusions are drawn:  
 According to the investigated experiments, reflows peak 
temperature , waiting time until the first overpressure (TAL), and 
the measure of overpressure level are demonstrated with 
significant interaction on void ratio. The regression analysis 
demonstrates  R2 value of 81.40%. This value explains that the 
model including the studied pr ocess variables (deduced from 
DOE) with the highest significance and coincidence measure of 
81.40% fits the void ratio data well. 18.60% are influencing 
variables such as the solder printing machines and the dynamic 
process variables in soldering process, which are not considered in 
this study.

60 designed so that a selective infrared soldering process is optionally 
applicable. In  the overpressure chamber, convection flow principle is used 
to transfer heat to the printed circuit assembly, and quartz (infrared) 
heater is used to apply additional heat to the unit. The combination of 
convection and quartz heating during overpressure p rocess ensures stable 
and reproducible temperature conditions. The overpressure chamber is 
equipped with two heating zones.  
   
  
1. The liquid solder is exposed to the first overpressure.  
2. Pressure is released to remove the trapped air or voids.  
3. The liqu id solder is exposed to overpressure for the second time.  
4. Pressure is released as soon as the alloy has solidified.

72 90 cm/min transport band speed is consider ed. If the first zone is setup 
for 250 °C, the minimum temperature in the second zone due to 
temperature balance of adjacent zones will be 203 °C. Also an alternative 
temperature of 212 °C which is very close to liquidus temperature is 
examined in the seco nd zone. As mentioned before, solder material in the 
second zone is cooled below the liquids temperature and there should be 
enough time so that the solder joint, during overpressure, is moved from 
the first to the second zone. Once the overpressure is rel eased, a fast 
cooling is required and hence two alternative measures are examined for 
the waiting time after the second pressure release. Table 5 is showing the 
setup profile for screening process in the second zon e.

18 pressure influences the boiling temperature of the solvent significantly. 
After melting the solder material, t he overpressure profiles show a much 
higher amount of voids in the solder joint than the profiles with negative 
pressure.

For both vacuum and overpressure profiles, the number of voids does not 
change significantly during the pressure release. The observed 
phenomenon can be explained with Le  Chatelier principle. This principle 
states that t he application of pressure on a gas producing chemical 
reaction slows this reaction down. The higher the pressure, the slower the 
reaction gets. It means that vacuum process support the reduction of

86 temperature of the solder is not affected by the pressure change, but the 
atmospheric pressure influences  the boiling temperature of the solvent 
significantly. After melting the solder material, the overpressure profiles 
show a much higher amount of voids in the solder joint than the profiles 
with negative pressure. For both vacuum and overpressure profiles, the 
number of voids does not change significantly during the pressure release. 
The higher the pressure, the slower the reaction gets. Therefore, vacuum 
support the reduction of oxides by the flux and overpressure process 
hinders it. It is inferred that vac uum processes exhibit a better wetting 
behavior of the solder than overpressure processes.  
A pressure change does not stop the chemical reaction of the flux and 
thus the production of gas. The formation of new voids does only stop"
